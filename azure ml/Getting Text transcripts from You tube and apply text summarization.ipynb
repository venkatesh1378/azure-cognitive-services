    "**What Are N-Grams(ngrams)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "N-grams are continuous sequences of words or symbols, or tokens in a document. In technical terms, they can be defined as the neighboring sequences of items in a document. They come into play when we deal with text data in NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks. They have a wide range of applications, like language models, semantic features, spelling correction, machine translation, text mining, etc."

       "\"yes yeah it's great thank you so before going to start I will give you some quick points and uh first thing is my voice is clear that is very happy to hear and this session is regarding to machine learning operations that is ml Ops so this session is both Theory and practicals okay Theory and practical practically about end to end flow end to end flow of mlos mlos so that is the first thing it is a both includes Theory as well as practicals and this session is about two hours I'm expecting for two hours it might be good for 2.5 hours also because this is a very very important topic we need to connect with cloud and we need to Showcase that how it is works and I will take all the question and answers I will give some pass in Middle as well as at the end so all q and a session you can take at n most probably you can note your questions I will give each and every one answers okay and first of all I need one confirmation how many of you know about data science data science and machine learning three parts one present four five yeah it's a good number of people or knows that's very appreciate that but this session is entered from scratch level okay so I will go with scratch from do to understand high level flow that means both Technical and non-technical people can understand I can say that so this session is from scratch some scratch those who don't know about machine learning don't know about machine learning also they can Now understand at least what is machine learning those who already know about machine learning they know about what is ml operations how it is working exactly so that is our end goal so there are two face of candidates I'm seeing here one knows ML and one don't know about ml but don't worry I will give from scratch level understanding you can understand easily in the both levels so coming to the myself I am omkar nalagoni um currently working as a senior data scientist senior data scientist senior data scientist with Accenture so I have total seven plus years experience in ID trainings in it and trainings and this seven plus years experience completely relevant and data science and mL of and some part of data Engineering also that is the cloud operations everything and I have completed my PG diploma PG diploma in data science from IIT tirupati IIT tirupati as well as I have a certified gcp ml engineering ml engineering and I have a certified in the Stanford University Stanford University deep learning course so I can say it is a deep learning code that is a cs-232 course ID is so that's all myself so we will quickly go to the our session now yeah it's okay even though if you are a Java student if you are not a IT background student this will understand that is not an issue Pawan yeah this I will go from very scratch level I'm just sharing my screen here and the today our topics to be covered is what is machine learning because what is machine learning we are using and what is the types of machine learning data science of life cycle and after that what is mL of why we use mL of mL of end-to-end workflow and finally we will Implement practical implementation of ml Ops using ml flow okay why we are going for machine learning types of machine learning data Sciences here there are all type of candidates will be available some people know about data science some people know don't know about that assigns so that's why bear with us those who are already know about machine learning okay so let's start the session so first one what is machine learning why it is important so in my case I can I can say easily so here I'm just going to the show presenter View and just ask Barts yeah data science data science and measure or machine learning machine learning is a part of a data science okay machine learning deep learning NLP is a part of data science ml is a modern astrology modern astrology I can proudly say this modern astrology what you will do in astrology in astrology in astrology you will predict the future you will predict the future but without any evidence without any evidence but data science and machine learning will predict the future DS or ml in the shortcut data sense is the DS machine learning is ml will predict the future predict the future with evidence with the solid evidence with solid evidence I can say solid evidence and this evidence comes from some mathematical algorithms this evidences comes from mathematics mathematics algorithms so those those mathematical all algorithms mathematical algorithms we are saying machine learning algorithm simple we are saying ml algorithms very simple so machine learning is generally it is the predict something by using mathematics that's all and that mathematics based on that we will develop so many ml algorithms like suppose I will give one example okay provide me your company employees attrition or the previous history suppose you have a company called some Google company is there take the example now Google give me a data they're the previous employees history those who are every year those who are leaving the company if you give me the data I will analyze the patterns I will analyze the patterns and I will say in the next couple of the years in the next years how many people how many employees will stick with your company how many employees stick with your company stick with your company we can say that suppose you are a sales you are a dmod owner you are a dmart owner you want to identify your loyal customers loyal customers give me give me employees sorry give me customers customers transaction data customer transaction data I can say who are your loyal customers who are your loyal customers I can say that suppose you are a bank manager suppose you are a bank manager you want to identify whether a person can pay the loan or don't pay the loan you can pay the loan or don't pay the loan don't pay the loan give me give me your M customers data previous data I can say easily you can pay the loan or don't pay the loan this is all our use cases these all our use cases that you can predict the company future by using called machine learning what machine learning will generally do it will analyze the data analyze the data and patterns it identifies some patterns Identify some patterns in the data patterns in the data using mathematics using math so I will give an example everyone knows a movie called super 30 right supercenting that's the famous Anand Kumar biography is a IIT trainer in that there is a scene called Truth Roshan went to a hotel okay he will say to the hotel guy your hotel will not run in next two years will not run in next two years he will say that if you remember that and he will say your hotel will not rain next two years that hotel will shock how it is happen then come up with some calculations okay so mathematics and if then the hotel guy will believe so that is the power of mathematics if you people if you say the statements people will not people will not convince conveyance with statements people will convince with numbers should talk not statements that is the beauty of data and Analysis people will convince with them if I say Usain Bolt will 100 meters run he can do in the eight seconds if I say that you will not believe but if I show the statistics of Usain Bolt you can definitely believe so that is the power of mathematics and those we are implementing the machine learning algorithm but how this will happen how this will happen how this will happen how this will happen how the patterns are happening how the patterns are happening everything how they are thinking now everyone talking about AI ml deep learning they're talking about that how these patterns are happening I will give one example in our families we have a kids is there right small kids you want to train your kid train your kid with some information some information train your kid with some information what is the information example one okay example one you are watching a TV you are watching a TV okay now you say you say to your kid your kid this is a TV this is your TV now because the kid is a human being human he can understand he can understand what you say and he will understand some patterns you will understand some patterns what is the patterns first pattern it is a rectangular box it is a rectangular box second pattern some color colors are there obviously in the TV some show is running colors will be there right some colors are there and third point some cartoon people also there you'll understand the cartoons you don't know about Shahrukh Khan you don't know what Salman Khan is coming in the TV right he will simply understand the cartoons so these patterns he can understand that means he understands the patterns he's not a system his nerve system is understanding the patterns that is we are talking about neurons nowadays in the Deep learning now second example now second example you went to the theater you went to the theater or Mall to watch a movie to watch a movie now ask a question to your kid now ask a question to your kid ask a question your kid what is this what is this now based on his patterns what is his patterns his rectangular box theater screenings rectangular box yes some colors are going yes some cartoons are going yes then what is you'll say answer he will say mama this is a TV now you will say no it is wrong it is wrong it is not a TV it is a theater then he will understand he will add the fourth pattern okay it's a big screen some big rectangular screen is there big rectangular screen is there so that he will understand okay if it is a small rectangular box is there it is a TV if it is a big rectangular box is there it is a theater now ask the third example now watch movie in laptop watch movie in laptop and ask the question what is this now he already know about the small thing is Stevia and big thing is rectangular that is a theater he will neither because he is a human being he can understand the pattern he will neither say he neither say TV nor say theater because he knows he is a human being the same thing how you are trained the information how you are trained the information how this guy is understanding the patterns if that information you are testing with new data texting with new data now you are understanding whether he can say right answer or wrong answer if it is say right you are happy your model is good if it is wrong again you are trading with new data so that's where that's where the machine learning will applicable actually so that's what is patterns how our human being in mindset we are discussing about patterns in the same way the mathematics also will discuss the patterns the mathematics will generate the patterns now if you see here we are sending a trained data we are creating some ml algorithm the model is created now in the same way you are providing you are a TV you are providing a theater now you are asking a question what is this he might be predicted something so that prediction you will do evaluate whether he say good okay if you say wrong again you need to train with the dose data so that way machine learning all Gardens will works I hope those who are don't know about machine learning now we can some extent he can know about the what is machine learning right can I say yes or no in the chart you can give me replay in the chat also I can pass one minute yeah thank you so next next we have some types of learnings will be happened because there are so much data is there right and the data is a huge data will be there so that's why what they are doing machine learning people they are dividing some types in that one type is called supervisor learning supervisor learning and another type is called unsupervised learning one more type is called reinforcement learning it is very easy guys supervisor learning means suppose you have a use cases there in the use case you have some input data is there and output data is there so what is input data and what is output data now coming to this Bank data suppose suppose you go here so this is a bank data some loan ID is there some gender is there education is there self-employed applicant income loan amount loan amount term is there and loan status so what is the objective of this data you need to identify the customer whether we can grant a loan him or not that is objective the objective is so for this loan IDK 1002 what is the status yes you are granted a loan you are not granted a loan okay so these kind of data if you see that means this loan ID gender education employed these are we can say input columns what we can say input columns and what you are seeing loan status we can say this is output column because you want to predict something so tomorrow I am going with my ID I am a male candidate I am a graduate I am not a self-employed and then my applicant income is there so whether he can provide the loan or not that means in the data you have some input data will be there and output that I will be there if you see that kind of thing we can say this is a supervisor learning we can say so I have seen some participants raise their hands but I will pass in Middle you can ask your question in the chat at the time I will definitely answer okay now next under the shoe I know we got what is supervised learning here so I'll just give an example here Super Wise to the learning supervised learning means we have some input data will be there input data will be there and corresponding we have output database also will be available output data but again in the input data and output you have a supervised learning in that supervisor learning again we have one more technique is called classification classification technique and second one is we can say regression technique classification regression what is the general English meaning of classification guys what the general meaning of English class meaning classification you are classified something classified something okay you are you are classification something like s or no some zones like support covet Jones nowadays Kobe Jones what is that green zone green zone orange Zone Red Zone some classification some parts are fail pass or fail these are the classification so here in the data here loan status is y is there and loan status is no is there s is there no is there it is a classification so first question is do we have output data yes do we have output data if thus output data is a categorical or not now next question is if that output data output data is in the form of categorical categorical some English names categorical then it is called classification technique simple so now I will a question this is a supervisor learning or not this data is a supervised learning or not yes it is a supervised learning how can we are saying it has input data is there and it has output data also there so it is a supervised learning next question it is a classification problem or regression problem now check the output if output is a categorical data of numerical data output is a categorical data so it is a classification problem now one more example I will take now here my objective is predict the total number of sales based on the advertisement cost on different medium I have a owner of some so so I am a owner of D Mart okay I want to increase my sales so what I decided I want to spend some money on some advertisement advertising so I spend some money on TV and newspaper and social media I want to predict my sales if I spend this much what is my sales 2000 if I spend this much what is my sales it is a 1950 so first of all do you identify the input here what is your input columns here TV newspaper social media what is your output column sales now tell me it is a supervised learning or not yes it is a supervised learning but if this your output is a numerical data or categorical data it is a numerical data now output is output is a numerical data numerical data so if it is a numerical data then that model we called regression model what is the model called regression model so that is the supervised learning that is the first one and next one if you see here next one is called unsupervised learning unsupervised learning so unsupervised learning is very simple guys supervised learning we are seeing some output data is there in the unsupervised learning we don't have output data very simple we don't have output data what is the example for that now see here the example for this this is called the objective is segment or group the customers based on the annual income and spending source now you are a d Mart owner now you have some customer IDC is there their age is there their gender is there and the annual income also there and the spending scores every month the customers are coming to your market and they are spending something money and you are giving some spending score based on the spending score you want to identify whether they are a rich customers or poor customers they are important customers are not important customers you want to group them so here there is no output data your our use case is I want to segment the people I want to divide the people how many people are my rich customers how many people are my poor customers I want to divide those groups so that's why it is called it is a unsupervised learning so that is the thing and what you are seeing is called some algorithms like I said machine learning is developed by mathematics so that mathematics we are calling ml algorithms so again machine learning is to divide it to three parts supervised and unsupervised so under supervise you have some classification problem is there and you have regression problem is safe so classification means you have a output data that is the step one and next that output data is categorical then go for these many algorithms decision trees Navi bias svm don't worry about these algorithms okay but just understand the high level View understand the high level view first of all machine learning is mathematics simple I will give you a funny example I'll see you at this you have a data is there when X is equal to 1 Y is equal to one X is equal to Y is equal to 4 X is equal 3 Y is equal to 9 x equal to 4 Y is equal to 16 when I say x is equal to 20 what Y is equal to tell me what is the Y is equal to put in you are answering the chart I just want to see your yeah very good 400. how did you say this 400 how did you say this 400 because in your mind you created some mathematics equation that is called Y is equal to x square this is ml algorithm guys this is a simple ml algorithm based on the previous data based on the previous data you predicted one ml algorithm then you are sending this x is equal to 20 to this algorithm it is giving Y is equal to 400 simple that's it now think about imagine as a big data is there for the Big Data you need some calculus and algebra mathematics we will develop some mathematical equation like this so those mathematical algorithms we have given some names that's all but mathematics is very simple mathematics that we are using that is algebra algebra and calculus all geographical so only simple mathematics we are not doing any integration or differentiation that we are not using here simple algebra and calculus we will develop some ml models I hope people should understand now what is exactly ml model means this is your history data you created a ml model now so now people already created some more ml models by using some mathematics we are using that now these are the some unsupervised learning algorithms and supervised learning algorithms don't worry about algorithms again I am saying that algorithms is nothing but some mathematics simple algorithms is nothing but a mathematics now coming to the reinforcement learning reinforming is generally agent agents should respond with our actions like iPhone Siri okay iPhone series is a hey Siri what is the time now if you say us it will give us some time right so that is a reinforcement learning so now robotic self-driving cars Alexa these are the reinforcement learning Earth Gardens so that's why we call so so I called AI nowadays yeah now if you see in 2019 I think in 2019 our ISRO uh do for mangalan 2. okay that is for the moon they actually should land at some place but due to the environmental condition it is landing some other place that's why it is failed here when it is landing it is not able to Landing successfully because the environmental conditions is not able to respond that agent so they implemented the AI condition in the ISRO environment but obviously the moon conditions is different there's a rocket science it's not an easy task so that's why we got some failure but is 95 success that is so like that way the reinforcement learning nowadays the so much money they are spending on this reinforcement learning so this is about the machine learning and the types guys so I will give one pass here okay I will give one pass and all the cluster algorithms are unsupervised algorithms yes you are correct all cluster algorithms are called unsupervised learning clustering nothing but grouping or segmentation your characterization if you have any doubts you can ask me I will give one minute we don't know cluster what is one me we don't know cluster how to pursue this course yeah this is a data science course that will be talk about management okay yeah yes that is another city that is our main event we'll talk about this all these things but at least you can identify the high level view right what is machine learning what is data science everything yeah then you can easily learn about cluster algorithms that is that you can say next what is the reinforcement Lending yeah course content I will that admin will take care of okay that is not our Workshop thing okay now okay we'll go to the next thing that admin will take that first you understand the concept end to end flow again at the end we will discuss about your doubts okay but in the middle I want to know the specific questions that is related to your Concepts now some people are algorithm reinforcement learning algorithm they are asking so reinforce rendering algorithms is completely a algorithms okay that is you can know hugging phase Transformers there's a example that is we can say hugging phase Transformers or robotics or Transformers are there there is a call hugging face Transformers okay hugging face hugging face or you can say YOLO there's a YOLO algorithm is there you look only once okay you look only once you can test type YOLO you will identify image objects for self-driving cars or moving objects they will identify like this there are some algorithms so next this is a very very important guys what is a data science life cycle what is a data sense life cycle so of course I told you again I learned mathematics Island everything I want to implement the programming language I need required is python okay those who are learning about python it is a very good course again I am saying that why this is python is a tool python is a tool python is a tool but data science is a subject it is a subject okay cyber security cyber security is a subject okay iot is a subject I what is a subject like that and cloud computing cloud computing is a subject okay cloud computing subject those who are learning the tools my best advice is learn any one of the subjects so that you can master that subject and there's a so much lifespan in the IIT carrier okay python is a tool those who are learning python the best choice is data science that is end to end you can know that so next so data science life cycle guys this is the data so any data science lifecycle not all any data science lifecycle guys suppose you I am a you are a data scientist I am a customer I am some HDFC Bank okay I'm HDFC Bank customer I want to know that my customer home loan capacity so first and most important is what you need to understand about business problem okay first of all what is your problem is the HDFC bank is coming to you and they will have some help for you then first what is that you need to understand about business problem what is your problem once you understand the problem once you understand the problem you need to collect the data the HDFC bank will provide data to you hfc bank will provide the data to you next this data might be a structured data or unstructured data data might be a structured data or unstructured data so this data might be a structured way or unstructured way okay now what you will do you will make a data preparation you make the data into structured way or you are putting into some database and ready to use some database you will make into some database you are load all this data to the in this database and the data is ready once data is ready this is the heart of data science guys we call Eda exploratory data analysis exploratory data analysis what you will do in the data analysis you will understand some insights understand some insight what is the inside what is the mean value what is the median value what is the mode what is the variance how it is going the all statistical Concepts what is the population how the sample is working and what is the hypothesis this is all a statistical Concepts if you remember your childhood days we know our statistics right so based on the statistics you need to identify based on statistics we need to identify Identify some patterns Identify some patterns we need to identify that so that's why EDI is a very very important and then once EDI is done we will develop our ml models so called mathematics models ml models you you said sir I created a model okay you said home cursor I created a model but how can I know your model is good or not how can you know your Y is equal to x square is a good correct model or not you developed a y is equal to x square and you said Assad this is my model verify this how can I verify by using model evaluation whether your model is correct or wrong I need to do the modal evaluation then finally your model is ready and I need to deploy your model deployments what this HDFC bank I should use right you created your model here but HDFC bank I should use that is a model deployment so this is a data science lifecycle guys you need to understand the business problem data collection data preparation the step by step no need to buy heart also this is this is common sense I need to understand the problem next I need to think about solution for to think about solution I need some resources here resources is the data science I have data is there I need to prepare the data in the organized way I data is prepared I need to do some statistical analysis because my duty is that data science duty is only to understand the patterns now I need to create a model my model is done now I want to verify this model is good or not that's the evaluation then I need to deploy the model because HDFC bank I should use now data science is completed with this now you created a model now you created a model think like this you created created a model I will take Y is equal to x square only because that you created from your mind just now okay I'm just kidding but why is equal to sphere your model you created that model Y is called x square now HDFC Bank should use that model HDFC Bank should use that model okay this Y is equal to x square you created a model by using python code by using python code is created by using python code now python code you run in your local python code you run in your local now how can HDFC guy use that how can HDFC I use your model that is the question number one question number one how can a client we can call client use your model so this we are in IT industry the term called production okay what would be the term is called production how can a client use your model in the production level how can a client use your model in the production level and second question the client is saying client is saying that saying that every month every month I will generate generate a new data new data how can your model respond how can your model respond on the new data and I should write my question first you created Y is equal to x square now how can you hand over to the client the production level next client is saying that every month I will generate a new data how can your model is respond now next third question is how can you monitor you can say monitor or track your model performance modal performance tell me these three questions that's it I'm good so this is your local everything is your local but how can you answer this all questions so that's where we coming mlogs machine learning operations now see here after model development after model development we need to ask some questions ourselves first question is how can we hand over a developed model to client which means how can we deploy our model on production level that is the first question valid question right this is a very valid question because your model is developed in a local system in my computer I developed but how can I hand over to the client it's a valid question now how can we train our model again on the fresh data now one like customers are coming in this month April and two lakh customers are coming in the June now your model you your python code should be generalized code right that code should train on the new data so that is the next question how can we train our model on fresh data in future on production level now third question how can we monitor or track our model performance now this month April month one lakh customers are there I created a model Y is equal to x square is my model my model performance is good I am getting accuracy is equal 90 percent now after June 2 lakhs customers are coming now if your model is training on the fresh data Maybe your model is performance will drop 70 percent will come how can you monitor or track the model performance so these are the all valid questions in the Cloud environment when we are transferring into the client production level so there one more thing is called how can we maintain the end-to-end flow from data ingestion to prediction like I told you right data is there injection and you need to do prediction so from here to Here There Is the End to End flow is there how can you maintain this end-to-end flow for client so where to answer all about questions our best practice is ml Ops now see the scenario in the two ways guys one is developing a model is one way and production as the model is another way production level okay developed a model is a data science people will do so to do the Productions ml engineering I will do ml engineering very simple ml engineering so I will say I will tell you a beautiful thing now in the AI world of AI rules in the world of Errors there are three kings are there first one is the data engineer guy what data engineer guy will do client will come HDFC bank will put some data into somewhere okay now the data engineer respond is you need to ingest the data to make use of the data science okay that is the data engineer guy so I'm a data engineer my response is what HDFC bank is giving a data to me I wants to put the data into in the Some Cloud environment some database or SQL Microsoft SQL Server so that data science guy can use the data that is a data engineer guy so this is a base level one now data is ready in the cloud data is ready in the database data is ready in the database okay then data science will come so what this value guy do you will understand the patterns and you will created a ml models it will create a ml models these are data science guy no third there is a ml engineer what this guy's response is he will make use of this ml model to the client in the production level clients should use production level so these are all important people in the world of AI without these guys data engineer data scientist and we can say ml engineer so these three guys are very very important so some maybe the model development doesn't know about this guy okay the model development doesn't know about this guy this guy knows model development this guy know how to make into production okay but as a good idea guy we need to know about how the data science algorithms will work and how the ml engineer should work now yeah I hope you understood right the rules how the roles are distinguished data engineer will ingest the data data scientists will do develop the model ml engineer will do productionize the model so this is the rules of in the three people so you can say ml Ops is a level three level three so I will just show you here for you make you easy I will just write here step one ingest the data step two develop ml models step 3 make use the ml models in the production environment the production environment so this guy is a data engineer guy this guy is a data science guy and this guy is a ml engineer guy MLG so where our ml Ops will come to here everyone else will come to here so data engineer guys Place data science guys will closely work each other closely work each other now data science guys plus ml engineering guys will closely work to each other closely work each other but they were ingesting a data industry data is a very hectic task okay there are so many people will requirement here much people needed here much people needed here in the same way MLG Engineering also much people required here because putting in the production level is not an easy task okay so that's why I always remember data science and MLG is the part this both combination if you know about data sense and MLG then you will lead the industry you can lead IIT easily data science and MLD no I know I hope you have some broad picture now but I just want to repeat again I just want repeat again so we have started with our machine learning what is about machine learning and we know about types of machine learning and we know about data sense life cycle and after model development what is the questions you need to ask yourself and then for to all these questions to answer we go for MLS okay now good high up till now you understand right everything the high level flow can I expect yes yeah to understood the high level flow yeah the questions I will take I will answer all the questions don't worry guys because this session is for you only okay this section is especially we are set up for you only to clear all your high level doubts clarifications we'll take online offline also both yeah we'll talk that at the end okay now see ml Ops is the full form is called machine learning operations that is clear what is mL of score function is machine learning is focused on machine learning models through the production that only I am telling right machine learning models to the production and then you need to maintain and you need to monitor very simple guys you need to put that in the production and monitor so mL of is a collaborative function of a data scientist guys and devops guys it's a combination thank God I am working some mL of project so even though I'm a data scientist so that I know about end to end flow so I very much thank to God because I have your opportunity to work with ML Ops also because I don't want stick as a guy with only I know models I know the interest I want to know about end to end flow you should be enthusiasm like that so that's why we are here to teach you now why we need mlos now you already have an answer why you need MLS because machine learning life cycle is a very complex life cycle you need to ingest the data you need to apply Eda you need to do feature engineering you need to do the model training you need to about model performance you need to the predictions you need to deployment monitoring and you need to do the automated model training that is there's so many life cycles are there but these life cycles are trust me guys you can enjoy this you can enjoy literally if you know about this data science and ml Ops you will enjoy the life you can you only do the so much work because these all are r d this is all our r d it is not like a daily routine toss it's not again like a rotant us it is like a complete R and a research and development we are in that so you know about why we need mlos now this where is a very very important thing guys mL of end-to-end workflow first two step is what ml development next ml development you need to create a training operations what is the training operations I will tell you so in ml development after ml development that means I can say ml development here step one ml development is there what is ml development you will do you will do data ingestion you will do okay data ingestion you do you will do data preparation you will do now you shouldn't you should say the steps now okay you do data preparation you will do Eda and you will do model building model building and you will do evaluation this is all your steps you do data ingestion data preparation Ada model building evaluation we will do that's clear this everything you will make one setup guys you will make create a DOT py file dot py file and some config file some config file you will create some dot py file some config file what is config file I hope I can show you that give me one minute give me one minute guys I can show you the some config file so this is a config file you see this is the config file I have created what is the Q a maker Community Services what is the storage Services what is auto complete Services I'm creating some names so that I can use my python code okay don't don't worry about Don't Panic about that okay I just want to show you that what is the config files okay what is your ID and how can you use that what is your suppose this what is your container name what is that's my name is landing what is your uh storage account name these all are some config files we are creating so once you created your ml everything you will create some dot py files some config file so that is the step one you need to do that is nothing but your training operations are ready why training operations are ready the client is already said client is already said every month he will get you will get a new data you will get a new data how can you train that you need to create a automated pipeline right you could need to create a automated pipeline that pipeline should do what data ingestion should do the component one component two component 3 component 4 component five these five components you need to create a pipeline so that you can continuously you can continuously continuously train the model train the model on new data so this is we can say CET continuous training so that's why we need to create this dot previous config files so you create you written data ingestion one function call data preparation is another function call Eda is another function call model building is another function called evaluation is another function call now total five function calls are called Phi components five components you created a pipeline you created a pipeline and that pipeline what it will do every time a new data will come it will do the same task it will do the same task data ingestion data preparation Ed every time it will do so this is the training operations the code and config we will do what it will do continuous training it will do after training operations what it will happen continuous training by using called training pipeline so one training is done you need to deploy your model by using call with register a model and then we will do the one the model deploy what is the using you need to serve right you need to prediction whether I can give the loan or not when I we can I can uh I can group the customers or not Productions by using a serving package and finally you need to monitor that by using all serving logs so these are the steps very simple you know what is the first step model development and second step this is the hard math this is the heart of machine learning continuous training because new data is coming I want to do the continuous training after training is happened I need to do the model deployment after deployment is happening I need to do the serve then I need to do the monitor I need to do the monitor I'll give one example here I'll give one example here you will understand with that example now suppose you want to send you want to send a courier a courier to your friend okay Courier or package career or package to your friend you lives in Hyderabad who lives in Hyderabad and your friend lives in Delhi your friend your friend lives in lives in Delhi so understand this example is very very important guys what you will do step one what you will do tell me what you will do you will go to The Courier Service you will go to the Courier Service Courier Service and register and register a your name register your name and Courier you will register this then step two so after register what you will do you will keep you will keep your package your package in The Courier office Courier office and step three they will give they will give one tracking ID they will give one track ID tracking ID so that you can track you can track you can track now step four think like that this you want to send you want to send another package another package in next month in next month so what will happen this is this month is package number one and next month is package number two and next month is package number three some distinguish package number one packet number two package number three some distinguish will be there now step five step five your friend should use end user your friend use use that package friend use that package so these are these life cycle Ma these are the entire life cycle about the package thing now this we will opt our ml Ops okay ready with dust now important steps need to consider mL of software model development your Courier you are going to The Courier office and you are register your package that means you developed a model you want to register your model that is called Model registry you register your package then you are keeping your package in The Courier office I register my model next step is I want to deploy my model deployment is the next step now you said I want to repeat this task that is the package number one package number two package number three now on the new data is a model created that is model number one in the next month it's the model number two and next month is the model number three that is called modal versioning and you want to track your model that is the performance modal versioning is nothing but model 1.0 Model 2.0 and finally you want to end user what is your use case finally so this is a complete mL of steps guys model registry model deployment model tracking model versioning model inference so this is the complete mL of theory I hope you understood that mL of Siri okay model registry model deployment model tracking model versioning I will tell you how can we register the model that is the Practical we will see now what happened to shamani in one minute guys yeah sorry guys yeah thank you ah now you and I hope you understood about ml Ops and everything now what is the Practical session okay let's go to the Practical session now but again with that I'm repeating again what we have done I'll just go to the my our slides previous slides the steps I need to do machine learning concept types of machine learning data science life cycle what is mL of why we use mL of and mL of Central and flow we have done this now with this I hope you understood about machine learning those who already know they can understand that I know very well okay but there are two two types of guys right those who already don't know about data science machine learning I hope you already know about high level View and those who already know about motion learning you know about how ml Ops is working that is now with this we will go for practical implementation so for this practical implementation I just want to use here Google collab notebook Google collab notebook Okay Google collab notebook we want to use that is why we use Google collab notebook why we use Google collab notebook so Google corrupt notebook is a free service pre-service is offering the Google notebook Jupiter notebook kind of it is there are many two things guys one is if it is a huge big data will be available if it is a huge big data will be available now Google collab notebook is offering from 25 GB data 25 GB data so that there is a huge data also you can process also also it can give one GPU access and TPU access one GPU access and TPU access and second one is second one is ml Ops generally is related to the cloud environment okay General it is a cloud anime you want to register a model right you want to deploy a model that we will use the cloud so the cloud packages installing Cloud packages installing Cloud packages installation is tricky is tricky when you in your local notebooks in your local Jupiter notebook so this is easy this is easy easy in Google collab notebook I like this actually because generally we usually work on the cloud packages so when we install in the local Red it is not at all installed properly okay we need to create a virtual environment s and all this thing we need to see so that's why it is easy in the Google collab notebook so we'll open a Google collab notebook now go to here just type Google collab just type Google collab and then it is a now it's a Google there's a new notebook option will be there click on the new notebook click on the new notebook now here in the top you see right Untitled 3 13 so I just want right here mL of workflow mL of workflow that is I'm given a name here in the top okay rename The Notebook so to work on the Google collab notebook guys you need to connect here the option there is a connect is there you need to internet you need to connect this that is the connection it is a connecting so we'll take some in time because go to internet issues or because of Internet fast it will go to that initialization and connect that now second step is you need to connect now it will give some Ram how much RAM it is 12.27 point GB that is there now I told you right we have one GPU and one TPU is there go to runtime now you have a change runtime type and there is a GPU is there and TPU is there so the GPU is there and TPU is there so if it is a big data you can use that if it is not big data don't use that that is not an issue and your file is there and code option is there text option is there the beauty of Google collab notebook is it is can work as a text Word document you can write some mathematics you can write some images and you can do the code also that is the beauty of this okay so GPU and TPU actually whenever you want to use that right whenever the big data is at to speed up the process to speed up the process we have GPU and we have TPU is there okay GPU and TPU like suppose you have a big data is there you have a big data is there whenever you have a big data you need to process very fast right whenever you want to very fast you want to process that we have local we have what CPU will be available locally we have CPU will be available well like four CPUs or three CPC level but GPU is a graphical Processing Unit generally will speed up your process speed of your process to load suppose think like that your data set your data set has one 10 lakh observation or 1 million observations 1 million observations to load 1 million observations how much time it will take in local how much time it will take local how much time will take in Google collab notebook that is the thing in collab notebook we have a GPU access and we have a TPU access so that it we can read very fast it can read very fast it will be very slow so I can say CPU is the lowest table GPU is highest level and TPU is the very fast TPU is a very fast okay so if you want the CPU this is the key inside GPU I can use our name TP is nothing but tensor tensor processing unit GP is nothing but graphical graphical processing unit and universe if you write what is CPU central processing unit Central processing unit okay now we are going to here again now I want to do my ml Ops here I just want right here ml offs okay so my my I just write the notes also that is a beauty I like this Jupiter notebooks because you can write the uh story also not only story like I can do the image also okay I'm going to here suppose MLS so I'm just taking one image okay I just want to show you this image which image I want to take okay this image I will take now go to the inspect and there's an image okay the image is there right you are seeing that image go to the edit as HTML just copy this and come to here go to the text and Page this see image is coming now that's the beauty you can do the mathematics also like this you can create the mathematics also okay now step one step one step one is any any any pack any code if you want right you need to install a required packages install required packages install a required packages now what is the packages we will use is we will use we want to install some packages so I will just display the packages names here so here we will use a numpy package and pandas package and sqln package and ml flow package okay numpy package used for what is a numerical python numerical python it is used for mathematics used for mathematics and pandas package user for data frame and data analysis sqln package is used for machine learning algorithms machine learning algorithms now ml flow is the ml flow is our ml operations platform mlos platform MLS platform now we'll see what is ml flow now we'll just write here ml flow so ml flow is a platform for machine learning life cycle now it is a ml Price look like this in the slow lane now in the few minutes you will get to know about what is this the latest version is 2.2.2 it is a cloud package it is a cloud package we need to install this so this is default it will be there default default python it will be there no need to install and here also this is pandas also no need to install no need to install and SQL and also no need to install ml flow is the cloud package we need to install this okay ml flow is we need to install that first ml flow is there or not there you just apply like this exclamatory Mark ml flow exclamatory Mark ml flow if you run this if it is installed you will get some to see something if it is not installed you will see command not found okay you will see command not found so that means it is not installed so we will install now that is PIP install ml flow simple if install ml flow now just install this pip install ml flow now very good it is installed so what it is installed mac o databricks docker git database git python and where is our ml flow here is ml flow you see right versus 2.2.2 now the same thing we will run here ml flow it is installed now so you will see something like this before what happened if it is not installed you'll see command not found after installation you can see the some information right this is good now next if you want to see the version also now if you want to see the version ml flow version so the latest version is what 2.2.2 now the same thing we have seen here 2.2 it is released in 14th March only so MLS is done now next thing is import required packages I hope you clear the first point right everyone we install a package in the step one we install a package in the step one now step two foreign what is that import required packages import required packages first package is import numpy as NP import ERS SP now now sqln model now I want to give the information here now here I want to use I want to use a regression model okay I want to use a regression model name called elasticnet the model name is what elastic net model this is a model name guys it is a regression model you already know what is the regression model right regression model is a supervised algorithm algorithm supervisor algorithm that means we have input will be there and output will be there but output is output is in numerical data output is numerical data for this we can use regression algorithms that you already know that is so what model I want to use I want to use a regression model what is the name of the model elasticnet so name of the model is elastic net data set I am taking is called wine quality data wine quality data what the data set name is called wine quality data that means I will tell you I will show the data set and I will tell you what is your wine quality data and platform we are using Google collab notebook Google collab notebook and the objective is here is objective what is your main target is we need to predict predict the quality of the quality of the wine so that is the data set name is called wine quality data and the model name is called elastic net this is clear so now from skln dot linear model dot linear model import elastic net will come automatically yeah elastic net that is done next from skln dot model selection dot model selection import train test split I will tell you what is the trend test split I will tell you next I want to evaluate my model also right for that from skln dot matrix import these are some metrics these are some metrics mean absolute error mean squared error and some R to score Don't Panic now okay these are the some metrics those already know about regression analysis they know very well those who don't know also don't need to panic once you learn you will easily understand only thing is this will give your model performance okay if this will give your moral performance that's why we are saying what metrics and this is a skeleton is a package inside we have a linear model inside we have a elastic net again sqln is the package inside we have a model selection and we are importing train test split I will tell you what is the strain test split next one is import ml flow and we can say import ml flow dot SK learning so these are my packages it is installed now step two is install the packages is done we are good at step two also right we are good at step two also yeah now step three step three read the data read the data step three is read the data now to read the data if you see here the file location is their files just click on this files now you will see some Arrow will be there whenever you click on the files you will see some Arrow now if you click on the Arrow I have some data sets will be there here I have wine quality red is there I am importing the data so now the data is there why in quality red again I'm repeating guys we have some files location is there click on the files location click on the up Arrow it will redirect to your locations okay now inside we have one data set will be there I uploaded that data now I will read my data I will read my data now data equal to PD dot read CSV PD dot read CSV I need to provide the path inside I need to provide the path there the three dots will be there here there are three dots will be there go to here there's a copy path will be available copy path now copy that and come to here and now apply data dot head it will give top five rows now see this is my data it is my data fixed acidity volatile acidity citric acid these all are some chemical names now we have a Target is what called quality is our Target quality is our Target variable quality so these all are input data sets and this is our output column it is a supervised learning and it is a regression problem it is a supervised supervised learning and it is a regression problem as simple as that now just understand the data what are the columns are there no see first we'll understand how many rows and how many columns are there that is give data dot shape so there are 149 and rows are there and 12 columns are there what it will give the information this data set and 12 columns are there 12 columns are there so in that 12 columns 11 columns are input columns input column that is X and one column that is what is the column name quality what is the column name quality now quality is output column output you can say Target column we generally denoted by small y okay so we have 1 5 9 and of course and 12 columns in the 12 11 columns are input columns and one column is called is very good it is a regression problem because we have quality is numerical data okay why it is a regression problem quality is a target output column output column has numerical data numerical data so that's why it is called regression yes very good numerical column now you got the points very good that is excellent now data dot shape now that is completed now you can see data dot columns also in the quick way so our interest is we are not doing any EDI here our interest is to deploy model on the mloffs what is our interest is our interest is model development model development and deployment to develop a model to develop a model make sure we have all the columns all the columns have numerical data why numerical data mathematics math works only on numbers only on numbers so if any categorical data is there we need to convert into numerical so first we will check where the numerical data is there or not for that data.info will apply data.info now it will see all our types of float float float no numerical node categorical data all our numerical data we are put and there's no null values also see all our normal it is a column number called fixed acidity number is 159 error rows and it is a no null values and data type is float 64. we are good you can check this also data dot is null dot sum if any null values is there for the corresponding column wise it will give the syntax so we don't have any null values so we are good we don't have null values and we have the data is numerical way so we can create our model development that is a step four now step four step four just write like this model development using ml flow now here I want to show you how the model development General will happen okay so step one is this is a very very important step guys we need to understand this is okay what I am telling you is now important everyone should understand first we divide we divide data into two parts two parts one is trained one is trained data and another one is test data okay we divide in two parts one is trained data and another is test data and second is train data as input and output tested data also as input and output again we divide we divide trained data train data into input data and okay input data and output that means input column separately output columns operating so that we can say exit train and wide train simple we divided input column separately and output columns separately and then the same way we divide test data into X test data and Y test data first of all train data data device data and test data both having input columns and output columns so we are separating into Excel train y train XO test and Y test and then model development model development happens on train data on trained data model development will happen on train data so next step is model development will happen trained data then once your model is created you need to test right so I want to model test so I want to model predictions model predictions happens on X test data accept test data so this will give this will give y predictions very simple guys I have created my model then I want to check my model is performed well or not so I will pass X test and model it will give some values that is we are calling y predictions finally finally I will compare I will compare my y predictions with Y test why predictions why predictions with Y test so this is the entire flow now I just want to show you maybe for write up you will confuse but I will show you now here how it will happen just see original data input columns are X1 X2 XP output column is y we divide into four parts train data test data again train data is extra train while train X test y test what does that mean think like that you have a data is like this you have a data is like this X is one two three four Y is one four nine sixteen twenty five First Step One is divide into two parts train data test data then exitrain y train X test y test now come here this is the trend at first three observations is the train data last two observations are the test data so it is a train data extra train white train test data is a last observation XO test y test now my model is applied on which data train data so I created a model called Y is equal to x square now I will pass 4 to the Y is equal to x square I will get a prediction called 16. I will pass Y is equal to Phi to the x square I will got the prestified so my predictions are what 16 and 25 now I will compare the 1625 already existed 16 and 25 so this is the comparison so this is generally ml development flow will happen I hope this is clear right understanding this is very very important guys so you generally divide the data that's it you generally divide the data into two parts that's the train data and test data and again EXO train and Y train so to do to do all these things to do all these things we have train test split English name Common Sense English common English name train test split it is a SK Ln package what is this sqln package so what I will do is I will divide I will divide my data into 70 30 ratio 70 30 ratio that means out of 5159 observations of 70 percent of 70 percent is my train data okay out of 1599 observations 30 percent is my test data now and also I will divide train and test data randomly I will divide randomly that means the idea how will be like one two three four five like this one and so one five nine n will be there so I will divide the train data I will pick first fifth observation I will pick 10th observation I'll pick 500 observation randomly I will pick okay y will pick randomly to avoid the bias to avoid the bias what is mean by bias suppose u r a you are a fan of Virat Kohli okay you are a fan of Virat Kohli I will call you I will ask you who is your favorite cricketer what you will say you'll say Virat Kohli only suppose Sharma and I will ask you who who is your fan Roy Sharma you will say so if I pick you the bias this is the bias if I pick the randomly this output might be different this output might be different this output might be different so Consolidated my model will give that good output so that's why Always divide the data randomly don't go with order okay one one two thousand is a trained data train data and one zero zero one two sixteen hundred is a test data this will give the bias don't go like this first thousand observation pick randomly second 1600 observation again pick randomly so this we will do what we will do divide data into 70 30 ratio and pick the observations in the randomly now we will do that okay how we'll do that here so train is one test is another one so I will apply train test split train test split inside I need to pass my data and I need to pass my test size is equal to 0.3 what is this mean we are dividing data into seventy thirty percent now I will apply random state random State equal to you can give any number one two three four you can give one two you can give anything you can give randomly it will pick okay now train dot shape and test dot shape okay now see out of 159 observations one one nine observation is your train data 480 observations are your test data now if I go for train dot head train.head I will see randomly it is speaking first of the reason is what 642 second observation 678 third four one two fourth one seventy three good right these are great actually we are dividing into 70 30 and we are applying random so if we got divided trained data and test data now we need to divide X to train and now now divide data into EXO train train X and train y input column output column separately we already know now train X equal to out of this all the columns if I remove this quality if I remove this quality remaining columns are what train data remaining columns are trained data so train dot drop I am dropping a column quality quality I'm dropping so it is a column so we need to give X is equal to 1. so that's the train data in the same way test data Test X so test data dot drop again same quality comma X is equal to 1. so we divided input data in the train data we divide we got the input data and test also we got the input data now we get the output one train why so out of this strain data if I select only quality column if I select only quality column that is my output data that is my output data so train dot now you can select only the quality that's it now test Y is equal to test quality now that's it we're done now you can check your train x dot shape dot shape and train y dot shape out of 12 columns 11 columns are input column and one column is what output column right see total trade observations are triple one nine in that 11 columns are your train X and only one column is what train y in the same way we have Test X and test y dot shape four AIT is eleven that the test data and one column is output data so we divided Trend test split is that clear rate till now if random state is 0 instead of picking 642 it will pick another value okay if you give another random state it will give you so how can you pass suppose I am giving one dot here if one dot okay how many lines how many lines can pass through one dot tell me what is your answer how many lines you can pass through one dot Infinity yes like that random State you can give any value it can pick infinite times maybe after 642 it will come after four one two will come after 73 will come 678 will come last so whenever you change this value the goal is fixed it will pick the randomly but the numbers will be different that's all now we'll go to the our main step now step fifth now start ml flow step fifth start ml flow start ml flow yeah next ml flow is a cloud algorithm ml flow is what ml flow is a cloud platform is a cloud platform now what I my what is my task I want to develop a model I want to develop a model and I want to deploy I want to deploy on ML flow one he need to deploy an ml flow next suppose Abhishek Abhishek is created another model one again you need to create a you need to deploy ml flow okay now this yeah random state that is a random state is nothing but again I told you right it is a randomly it will pick that well randomly it will pick that that is a random state okay I hope I given your answer already yeah one two three four that only if I given random State equal to one two three four now tell me like this one comma 2 comma three comma four comma five six seven eight nine ten now randomly it will stop with one after that how many combinations will come second letter how many combinations second letter will come how many combinations third letter will come how many combination fourth letter will come randomly many right so that many we will provide by using called random state random state if you give random State equal to one it will give one order two three four like one one one one one one one one one one like this so whenever you change your random State the numbers will be changed here that's why I am explaining okay yeah so next so understand this is guys this start ml flow is very very important now omkar creates one model you want to deploy an ml flow object created one model he wants to display an ml flow that means what ml flow will do ml flow will create some workspace some workspace for you some workspace in the name of in the name of experiment what is the name here name of experiment remember this ml flow will create some workspace in the name of experiment so first we need to create our experiment what we'll do first to create our experiment so that is ml flow dot set experiment set experiment I'm giving some path my path is ml flow ml flow and you are giving mL of ml Ops workspace MLS workspace so this is my name this is my workspace name you can create your own workspace okay you can give any name also you can give narration M also here okay you can give your name also that means you are setting a experiment why you are setting your experiment there are thousands of people who can create their model and they want to deploy an ml flow ml flow should understand what is your experiment name what is your workspace name that ml flow should understand that that's why we are creating a experiment name now this experiment is not there so you see here experiment with name ml flow mL of workspace does not exist so we are creating and this is your experiment ID and this is the life stages active and artifact location I will tell you what is artifact location it will go to this location this is the location path okay we'll just print some values we'll just print some values so print I'll just copy this dot experiment ID I'm just giving experiment ID and again I am print this because I want to use that ID I want to use that ID so life cycle stage is active again print and you can give name also so if I print all these three now first one is my experiment ID name this is my experiment ID so now this is your ID now your workspace is active what is your workspace name ml flow mL of workspace I hope this you clear now right can I get answer in the chat box this is understanding is important ml flow set experiment yeah code now experiment is ready now we'll go to the code now we'll go to the code now so I will create some function call because I want to write multiple times so what I will do is I will create some function call So Def train model deftrain model is my function called name so first step is what developed develop train test split I want to divide my data that I already show you how to divide the data so we'll just copy from there because we already did that so what I will do is I will take this I'm taking this this is I have done separated to make you understand guys okay this add-on separated to make you understand because understanding that is very very important now this is we have taken so this is important so I just remove this I don't want this okay now your train model is done now now second is initiate the ml flow now initiate initiate ml flow now so we are initiating now with ml flow dot start run let us start run is there ml flow dot start run inside it is asking some experiment ID you need to provide your experiment ID what is your run name okay you can give your name also and you can give a description also so I am providing my experiment ID experiment ID what is my experiment ID so this is my experiment ID right this is my experiment ID comma my run name I want to provide run name also that is it is a regression it is a regression and I will provide the description also it is a description also I want to provide what is the description here anything anything you can write performing a regression analysis so this all we can see UI now ml flow UI we can see this all so this is the function call so we are putting colons here and we are running this okay experiment ID a run name and description now Now call ml model now call ml model what is your ml model name ml model name is called elasticnet so I can give LR equal to I am taking a variable name called LR because linear regression so elastic net elastic net so inside what are the parameters are coming Alpha is the one parameter and L1 ratio is another parameter there are two parameters one is Alpha and another is L1 ratio so I am giving Alpha Alpha is equal to some Alpha I am providing and L1 ratio L1 ratio equal to L1 ratio I'm providing because these are my parameters I want to change these parameters every time I created a new model okay mind it that I want to change these parameters I am creating a new model so L1 ratio why this is error is coming because these are the parameters we need to give you the function also Alpha comma L1 ratio now this will gone now elastic net is there now fit now develop your model model development on which data train data so train X comma train y this is your model is developed so model creation is happened now what we'll do model prediction now model prediction model prediction will happen on which data X test data X test data model prediction will be happen so that is predicted data predicted data equal to LR dot predict because your model is which name is there LR so LR dot predict which data you need to pass Test X so this is model prediction now be careful guys just understand this three steps first train test plate next call the model next fit the model next model prediction so next what we will do model evaluation model evaluation now model evaluation what are your evaluation techniques you have taken rmse this three mean absolute error main square error R2 Square so model evaluation will compare on which data which data model evaluation predictions versus test data prediction forces test data so that we will do evaluation now that we will do evaluation so here rmsc equal to NP dot square root NP dot square root mean squared error mean squared error bracket you need to compare with your test y with the predicted data simple now RMS RMS root mean square error guys RMS is nothing but what root mean square error I will tell you what is the root mean square error so first error equal to your actual value y actual value minus y predicted value okay suppose actual value is equals 16 is there your model is predicted as 17. how much your error is getting minus 1 like that so this is error now we need to mean square error so first we need to square this and then we need to apply mean is nothing but summation of many observations first observation first error error one second observation error 2. third observation error 3. so you need to combine all the errors Error 1 Plus error 2 Place error 3 error 3 and this we are squaring Square 1 square 2 square 3 we are applying a mean so this is called main square error the name itself what mean square error if you apply the root that is called rmse so this is a metric okay I'm not going to about much deal much deeper in that because that is not our interest right I just want to give you a quick glance what is rmse it is a root main square error that is a rmsc next mea e m a is nothing but mean absolute error these are the metrics these are the Matrix main absolute error so again same y test sorry test y comma predicted data again R2 Square R2 is equal to R2 score of test y comma predicted data so this is the full plasma so we are calling model modal prediction modal evaluation till now is that clear everyone foreign we will do that I am not coming to that way okay we'll do that model register we will do okay we are going step by step good now you need to log these parameters what is the next step is important is I want to track my I want to track my modal parameters and model metrics and model name so this is called we are registering we want to register our models we want to register our metrics we want to register our parameters so for that what we will do is we need to go for here we need to log that parameters you can print also while doing you can print also I'll just print this okay print print Mia sorry comma Mae and print that R2 score comma R2 score so we are printing now next important is what log The Matrix log this Matrix parameters parameters and model on ML flow on ML flow okay so now ml flow DOT log under the log we have artifacts is there Matrix is there param scissor okay so we are going for log param so log param on which name I want to log this my name is Alpha Alpha is my name I want to log Alpha again same ml flow DOT log param what is I what is the param now L1 ratio L1 ratio is my param that is called L1 ratio so parameters are completed now ml flow now Matrix now there are three metrics are there ml flow ml flow DOT log metric DOT log metric okay what is the metric first one RMS is my metric name whatever you give here name that will be visible guys if you give your your name that will be visible okay so rmsc and same thing I want to just copy here two times but here is Mia [Music] and here Mae and then here R2 square that is equal to R2 now this is done now I want to log what I want to log my model also ml for ML flow Dot skln so we have already sqln is there right skln DOT log model what is that DOT log model what is your model name your model name is what LR what your model name LR so my model name is called LR comma the name is called modal now what is your register model I want to register my model I want to register my model so registered model name is equal to elastic net my model name is called elasticnet once you created your LR model that will be under the model it will register we will see that now how it will happen now I'm just running this okay now what are the two parameters taking Alpha and L1 ratio we are calling this train model okay now we are calling this so I am giving here suppose 0.3 and I'm giving here 0.2 now I'm running this now see rmsc is this Mei is this now you see successfully model is registered with name what elastic net and what is the version version is one these are important to notice what your model name is called elastic net what is the version version is one now whenever you run in the left side there is a ml runs folder will be created okay in the left side ml runs folder will be created if you click on the ml runs if you click on the ml runs there is a your experiment ID will be there if you notice this is your experiment ID guys okay go to here check your experiment ID where is the experiment IDC so this experimentary five six five three two five six five three to your experiment ID now here your models is there in the model there is a model m is what elastic net that you given right elastic net that model you given here elastic net what is the version here only one version only one version is there now if you click on the version if you click on this method.aml you will see what is the timestamp what is updated what is the name what is the Run ID this is important what is the Run ID with this run ID if you go to your experiments the same run IDs will be there here see same run ID now if you go to the inside run ID we have five things one is artifacts Matrix params and tags Matrix means what you log rmse Mia R2 that Matrix will come to here what is the value 0.51 see 0.51 is your value what is R2 0.23 is your value what is rmse 0.66 your value this is a matrix and what parents you given Alpha and L1 ratio 0.3 and 0.2 so this is the artifacts artifacts is nothing but your model that pickle will be available so your model now you can hand over to client bios called Model dot pickle and to run this entire setup what is your requirement.txt I need ml flow This Cloud pickle pathlib sqln typing extension so everything will be available here guys okay everything will be available here so again I am repeating so just see here just notice this so this is not the final thing we need to show this in the ml flow UI that is our ultimate goal okay now see here whenever you created your ml flow workspace they clearly say artifact location is content ml runs three two five three two so whenever you run your code it will create a ml runs inside it will create a experiment ID now inside you are you have run only one time right that's why one runide is created suppose I have run two second time now see see the beauty here suppose I given a value is called four argument value is called five now same name that means I am running second time understood the same name I am running second time that mean now version 2 should create right now I run this now neuron new run ID Now new version is created version two now you go here you go here just refresh this go to your models elastic net is your name only only one name under one name how many versions is created now two versions version one version two what is your version ID what is your version ID is your version ID now go inside the experiment now you can see seven to be user one more IDE and all your metrics will be now here params everything will be here so this is how it will works ml flow now our main goal is we need to show we need to show this on ML flow UI first of all are you understand till now this yeah yes correct exactly two metrics we can use many metrics Nani okay why we are drop quality we are not dropping we are dropping and we are processing here you see here okay that is the overall story right I'm saying while you are passing you are creating your model we are not dropping you are passing your train X and train y why is your quality only okay ml models packages python packages will create such that you need to pass your input and output separately that's why we are dropping okay now everything we are logging not only rmsc meae there are so many metrics will be available once you learn about data science course you will get to know that okay next now you understand now what is our goal is ml flow UI now think like this now I want to go to the ml flow UI so this is your Google collab notebook okay this is your Google column book this is your ml flow platform this is your ml flow UI whatever you done now you need to transfer here right to do this to do this we need to create some tunnel what you need to create a tunnel tunnel you need to create normal English name create so to connect Google collab to ml flow UI we need to create a tunnel what we need to create tunnel so I will tell you what is the tunnel now so now I will give all answers now at the end now okay because it should not miss the flow ml flow UI to run to create to create ml flow UI from Google collab notebook Google collab notebook we need to create a tunnel we need to create a tunnel and that tunnel name is called the tunnel name is ngrok what is the name is called ngrok Remember the Name n grok what is the name n Grog what is ngrok ngrok is your tunnel who is created this way the road okay the company name the company name is ngrok what the company will do it will create a tunnel from your local collab notebook to your UI that is called tunnel normal English name it is a road the road company name is called ngrok company name is what n grok now we will pip install pip install and grog first okay I need to install that ngrok now n grok is installing and grock is installing now n gruck is installed now what we will do is we'll try to create a tunnel create a tunnel now create a tunnel we will create a tunnel so pip install from pi and grok import ngrok okay pi and grok I think we need to install pi and grock I think not only nutritional Pine Grove because ngrok is not working nowadays will work okay and grog they are removing engrock actually they are calling that the pi and Croc so pi and grok and grog so next we need to create a tunnel tunnel and grow I will give a name called ngrok tunnel I will give you and grog tunnel equal to n grok dot connect it is a UI right whenever you want to connect a UI we need to give some address also that address generally people will give 5000 report okay and prototype also we need to give that is http so this is I don't need to explain because there is a UI UI should be in our server so that's why we are giving 5000 port in the http now what we will do will print will print a tracking URI a tracking URI with the name of tracking URI I want to track my n Grog underscore tunnel Dot Public URI anyone can access public URL I'm just clicking this okay very simple guys we are tunnel this is a company company name is called ngrok we are connecting with address 5000. I'm just clicking this when I clicking this what they are saying traffic was successfully tunnel to the ngrok agent but agent failed to establish now we created a tunnel successfully but this agent is not giving permission to create a UI why this is Agent is not given permission because you should not provide a authenticated ID the agent doesn't know the agent agent doesn't know doesn't know your ID your ID so that's why he is not giving permission he is not giving permission simple guys first what we are going we are going to a company called ngrok to make a tunnel from which place to which place Google collab Notebook 2 Google collab Notebook 2 your ml flow UI ml flow UI so we created a tunnel but the tunnel is not giving permission because we doesn't provide our ID now what we will do we will provide our ID now so get help with this error now it will reach to here you just click on the login just click on the login now when you log in it will ask your email ID and it will create with homecare.nalagoni real gmail.com okay it whenever you log in it will ask your Gmail ID we already have Gmail ID is open that's why it is going directly now go into the your Authentication go to the or authentication now this is your authentication ID okay I just pass into the uh Google collab notebook okay like this I'm going to edit as HTML I just copy this I'm just pasting in the Google collab notebook and just paste here so that I can access from here only so this is my ID this is my ID so this is my auth ID so authentication ID authentication token equal to this is my authority so my given my authentication ID now same thing I will take okay same thing I am taking if you have authentication ID you don't need to go to here guys okay no need to go to here if you don't have authentication ID first run this then it will redirect to one place it will redirect to one place and then if you go to help it will redirect to another place then login it will redirect to your Gmail gmail.com from there you will get authentication token directly copy for every email ID one authentication token will be available one authentication token will be available the postman we can't use Abhishek here that's a different case in the API testing so this is a creating a tunnels okay now undershow right if you have authentication token is there don't go directly here directly you can write like this so I am creating this here if already a tunnel is established I want to kill the tunnel so I want to do n grog.kill already a tunnel is already existed I am killing the tunnel okay so this is I can say if any tunnels are there if any open tunnels are there close that so for that n grok dot kill now authentication token now and now said that n grok dot set Auto token author token your auth token what is your author token authorization underscore to again I have set my token my set so I given my ID when I given my ID I can create the tunnel now simple step by step understand the steps if any tunnels are there kill the tunnels cue your authentication token set your token and create the tunnel now tunnel is created okay now we'll click on this when I click on this now see there is no error it is asking visit site when it is asking visit site this is we are we are success we're good so for that we need to run ml flow UI we need to run what ml flow UI we need to run so ml flow UI whenever you run and then you go to here within the site when you visit the site it will create a UI see how beautifully the UI is now again I'm repeating guys one we provided authentication token we run this it will cost the visit site once it is done you need to run your ml flow UI until you work on this this code is still run only now we'll just familiar with ML flow UI what is your experiment ID tell me what is your experiment ID name what is your workspace name what your workspace name guys ml offs underscore something one right see this is your workspace ml flow ml Ops workspace how many times you model do you run two times you have run one is 16 minutes ago another is 12 minutes ago what is your model name one is first one version 16 minutes ago you have run that is the one version one 12 minutes ago you have run that is version two now if you click on place you have Matrix is there your parameters is there you can compare those also now first time when I run that is 0.511 and second time 0.547 first time when I run 0.662 second time 0.694 this way is nothing but model tracking modal performance model monitor okay we'll go step by step again this is ml flow workspace inside how many times you create a run your model two times what is your run name regression is your our run name what is your Matrix we already logged all these metrics now I'm just clicking on regression now this is your run ID this is your run ID and model is registered here model is registered on 2023 0 4 16. what is the name of the model elastic net what is the version is a V1 now your model is registered this is your model.pickle file this is your amml file ml file will give you what what is the dependencies what is the PIP functions and everything this is your ml model everything so if you download this if you download this you can hand out to your client he can run and he can get the output that's be some simple that is okay now parameters under this run ID what are the values under this run ID what are the metrics and what are the work model everything that is your models artifacts and everything and they also given your prediction code also you can directly call this one and you can do this so we'll go step by step again okay first step go to your workspace understand this UI how many times you have run two times what is your run name regression what is your model name elastic net go to your models how many what is your model name elasticnet what is your latest version version 2 click on this how many times you have run two times one is version one another is version two so it is tracking version also if you run one more thing it is version three it is version 3. now do you feel which version of model is good do you feel do you feel which version of model is good support is saying sir my version one model is good version one model is good suppose Abhishek is saying my version model is good my version is model is good now there's a two steps will be there guys one is staging and another one is production okay staging is nothing but what staging is nothing but it is a Alpha version Alpha version production is nothing but beta version that means staging is nothing but it is on our local systems it is internal use internal use that means we are not given to the client to that those models are in the production level that client can use okay in outside industry we have two things are there one staging will be there another one is production is there I am thinking I am thinking version one version one is a good model is a good model that can go into the production level is saying that sir my version one model is good I want to set up into the production level so for that what we will use we will go to the version one then the stage will be there transition to staging transition to production or you don't want to use this model go to Archive so version one is model is good I want to use in the production then I am putting the production level now I'll go to my elastic net I am going to my models now my elastic net is my model name what is my latest version version 2 is my latest version but what is in the production production is the version one is there in the production now you think version 2 is in the staging now go to in the version 2 put in the staging environment now people will think like that this version 2 is now in the staging level already version 1 is sending into the production level so client can use the version one model but version 2 is in the internal use only still development is going on that is the meaning of staging level this is a meaning of production level and you can go to the experiments and you can get the version to model also from your workspace this is a version 2 model this is a run ID this is a metrics everything will be there so this is we are logging we are register the model we are deploy the model we are tracking the model we are model versioning is happening and finally in next few minutes we will inference the model also we will see so this is the beauty of ml Ops guys s now I will give pass you can ask me if any doubts thank you Abhishek you can put in the chat because we almost completed this and only the inferencing is there I will show the inference also now if you want ppds mL of a third party server provider exactly rajwal mL of you know the beauty of this one uh how it is only three guys are rolling here okay only three guys in the world one is gcp one is AWS one is azure okay now what we'll do I am working with Accenture right so called Accenture or TCS or Infosys we don't have any Cloud setup right we don't have any Cloud setup what we will do we will pay the money to will pay the money to either gcp Service as an AWS service or Azure service so they will offer this mlos platform or automl so called like this they will perform like this so ml Ops now databricks is there that is also you can use ml office tie up with so many companies ml flow like that so every new data we need to work on the lower environment once we test in the stage exactly exactly that is the correct but we need to create some Pipelines okay you will not create automatically you every time you should not go you should not create you will create some Pipelines how the pipelines will be there data ingestion and then data pre-processing pre-processing and data Eda now Eda is the very biggest star spread in the ideas there are so many drop tasks will be there feature selection will be there feature engineering will be there so many things will be there and then we'll deploy a models and then you log enter everything yeah yeah that is the GitHub actions is important now you you I developed a suppose in my team inviting five members are there okay five members are there I have worked I have worked on model development okay you are working you are working on Eda okay some other person is working on data ingestion we all created dot py files only dot py it's also dot py file only this is also dot P Wi-Fi only now this all dot pofi now I there's a GitHub is there now you will push your code in the GitHub or GitHub or devops whatever it is you will push your record in the GitHub GitHub and this guy also put your code in the GitHub there's a one guy is there devops guy there's a one guy is the devops guy what he will do he will Consolidated our course Consolidated our codes and he will trigger the pipeline so that course can be updated course can be updated once course can be updated with new code with a new code your pipeline tree will trigger your ml flow will be triggered so that is called git actions that is also we will end in our narration so new data never go directly to the plot no never produce production level client should use client will ask many questions you know you know right how many client will ask the questions they never understand anything but we need to explain to them everything so never go directly actual Android is what is happening right so I am working a company called make SM okay now make a sin so we are developing some ml models to the vacation we are developing some ml models now the makers and the data from the data they are getting from PWC PWC that means PWC is responding for data they will give the medicine now make a sent equal to the Accenture now data engineering guys will do the data ingestion now data science will guide to the model development now ml engineering I will do the mL of both are same you are doing the same task nowadays now these guys always talk with PWC data now this guy will say extend to the makasan how it is happening and everything like that yeah yeah Roshan you can contact with admin we are we are starting that MLS batch so once client everyone certified share will push the product correct venkat you're absolutely correct our model do Ed automatically yeah we need to create some Pipelines okay but this you need to contact with uh admin okay yeah we'll create a Pipelines so it is not over those completed data science so we can uh data sense it is good for two data science also if you know the good go to data sense then you can do that or you can call to uht we will give a clear guidance on this actually we have one more step is there guys okay wait for last minute okay we have one more step is there what is our one more step we reduce the predictions just copy this okay I'm just stopping this now okay now this is my model this is my model which model version 2 model I am loading my model I want to pass my test text then I will get my outputs these are my outputs if any new data will come they'll directly pass here and they will get the output as simple as that because this is a free version that's why we are stopping and we are running and we are going and checking there's a paid versions will be there actually if you pay that then you can do automatically this that thing if this is a prepared version is not a paid version that's why we are stopping here when you stop your ml flow will gone does UI will gone so that is a simple drawback here because we are using a free version right that's why so now this is a end to end ml flow guys I hope you understood the everything flow okay I hope that we have a very good session we have very good session you understand some extent some extent you understood how the life cycle how the data science life cycle will happen life cycle will happen so I'm expecting that you can you can say that in the chat also need to Deep dive more yeah this is a simple task Workshop is not like that Workshop is not like that it is a simple like it is a first task so that in the going on we can do more tasks also that is but what we learn what is ml villain and next types of ml villain and we learn data science lifecycle we learn and we have seen some good examples also why we need ml Ops N2 and end to end flow of mL of and we learn about practical implementation practical implementation using ml flow ml flow so we covered many things yeah yeah if any any course related because I am a trainer right I uh that any course related any course related okay enrollments and everything the admin guy is there at naresh ID so admin guys are very they are Cooperative they will explain each and everything for you you can contact to directory we always try to give the best teaching and best Concepts to you we always yes definitely Pawan because data science people know only what you know only to create models right yeah tfx everything you're correct airflow could be flow everything will be there you're right yes in the cloud that is specific Cloud we use gcp gcp we can do that AWS or azure databricks we'll do that say subbu what is happening right uh I can say AWS Azure and everything is like a mobile phone okay if you know one thing you can know other easily if you know gcp no one can teach for Azure also you can easily know Azure also only the things like a real me phone and iPhone and Samsung phone that's all okay yeah ml apps using tensorflow that's a t f x t f x and Kobe flow and ml flow is all MLS yes Roshan you're right yes all sessions are Hands-On only mL of means Hands-On that's it so that you need to contact with uh yes we'll cover all these things yeah batch and duration everything please contact to admin I hope you have a good session so we always here to provide a best teaching facility to you yeah you can contact everything is admin they will give a best supportive I hope you enjoyed the session guys yeah place a yes yeah thank you thank you so much guys bye take care we'll see you\""

learig operatios that is ml Ops so this sessio is both Theory ad practicals okay Theory ad practical practically about ed to ed flow ed to ed flow of mlos mlos so that is the first thig it is a both icludes Theory as well as practicals ad this sessio is about two hours I'm expectig for two hours it might be good for 2.5 hours also because this is a very very importat topic we eed to coect with cloud ad we eed to Showcase that how it is works ad I will take all the questio ad aswers I will give some pass i Middle as well as at the ed so all q ad a sessio you ca take at  most probably you ca ote your questios I will give each ad every oe aswers okay ad first of all I eed oe cofirmatio how may of you kow about data sciece data sciece ad machie learig three parts oe preset four five yeah it's a good umber of people or kows that's very appreciate that but this sessio is etered from scratch level okay so I will go with scratch from do to uderstad high level flow that meas both Techical ad o-techical people ca uderstad I ca say that so this sessio is from scratch some scratch those who do't kow about machie learig do't kow about machie learig also they ca Now uderstad at least what is machie learig those who already kow about machie learig they kow about what is ml operatios how it is workig exactly so that is our ed goal so there are two face of cadidates I'm seeig here oe kows ML ad oe do't kow about ml but do't worry I will give from scratch level uderstadig you ca uderstad easily i the both levels so comig to the myself I am omkar alagoi um curretly workig as a seior data scietist seior data scietist seior data scietist with Acceture so I have total seve plus years experiece i ID traiigs i it ad traiigs ad this seve plus years experiece completely relevat ad data sciece ad mL of ad some part of data Egieerig also that is the cloud operatios everythig ad I have completed my PG diploma PG diploma i data sciece from IIT tirupati IIT tirupati as well as I have a certified gcp ml egieerig ml egieerig ad I have a certified i the Staford Uiversity Staford Uiversity deep learig course so I ca say it is a deep learig code that is a cs-232 course ID is so that's all myself so we will quickly go to the our sessio ow yeah it's okay eve though if you are a Java studet if you are ot a IT backgroud studet this will uderstad that is ot a issue Pawa yeah this I will go from very scratch level I'm just sharig my scree here ad the today our topics to be covered is what is machie learig because what is machie learig we are usig ad what is the types of machie learig data sciece of life cycle ad after that what is mL of why we use mL of mL of ed-to-ed workflow ad fially we will Implemet practical implemetatio of ml Ops usig ml flow okay why we are goig for machie learig types of machie learig data Scieces here there are all type of cadidates will be available some people kow about data sciece some people kow do't kow about that assigs so that's why bear with us those who are already kow about machie learig okay so let's start the sessio so first oe what is machie learig why it is importat so i my case I ca I ca say easily so here I'm just goig to the show preseter View ad just ask Barts yeah data sciece data sciece ad measure or machie learig machie learig is a part of a data sciece okay machie learig deep learig NLP is a part of data sciece ml is a moder astrology moder astrology I ca proudly say this moder astrology what you will do i astrology i astrology i astrology you will predict the future you will predict the future but without ay evidece without ay evidece but data sciece ad machie learig will predict the future DS or ml i the shortcut data sese is the DS machie learig is ml will predict the future predict the future with evidece with the solid evidece with solid evidece I ca say solid evidece ad this evidece comes from some mathematical algorithms this evideces comes from mathematics mathematics algorithms so those those mathematical all algorithms mathematical algorithms we are sayig machie learig algorithm simple we are sayig ml algorithms very simple so machie learig is geerally it is the predict somethig by usig mathematics that's all ad that mathematics based o that we will develop so may ml algorithms like suppose I will give oe example okay provide me your compay employees attritio or the previous history suppose you have a compay called some Google compay is there take the example ow Google give me a data they're the previous employees history those who are every year those who are leavig the compay if you give me the data I will aalyze the patters I will aalyze the patters ad I will say i the ext couple of the years i the ext years how may people how may employees will stick with your compay how may employees stick with your compay stick with your compay we ca say that suppose you are a sales you are a dmod ower you are a dmart ower you wat to idetify your loyal customers loyal customers give me give me employees sorry give me customers customers trasactio data customer trasactio data I ca say who are your loyal customers who are your loyal customers I ca say that suppose you are a bak maager suppose you are a bak maager you wat to idetify whether a perso ca pay the loa or do't pay the loa you ca pay the loa or do't pay the loa do't pay the loa give me give me your M customers data previous data I ca say easily you ca pay the loa or do't pay the loa this is all our use cases these all our use cases that you ca predict the compay future by usig called machie learig what machie learig will geerally do it will aalyze the data aalyze the data ad patters it idetifies some patters Idetify some patters i the data patters i the data usig mathematics usig math so I will give a example everyoe kows a movie called super 30 right supercetig that's the famous Aad Kumar biography is a IIT traier i that there is a scee called Truth Rosha wet to a hotel okay he will say to the hotel guy your hotel will ot ru i ext two years will ot ru i ext two years he will say that if you remember that ad he will say your hotel will ot rai ext two years that hotel will shock how it is happe the come up with some calculatios okay so mathematics ad if the the hotel guy will believe so that is the power of mathematics if you people if you say the statemets people will ot people will ot covice coveyace with statemets people will covice with umbers should talk ot statemets that is the beauty of data ad Aalysis people will covice with them if I say Usai Bolt will 100 meters ru he ca do i the eight secods if I say that you will ot believe but if I show the statistics of Usai Bolt you ca defiitely believe so that is the power of mathematics ad those we are implemetig the machie learig algorithm but how this will happe how this will happe how this will happe how this will happe how the patters are happeig how the patters are happeig everythig how they are thikig ow everyoe talkig about AI ml deep learig they're talkig about that how these patters are happeig I will give oe example i our families we have a kids is there right small kids you wat to trai your kid trai your kid with some iformatio some iformatio trai your kid with some iformatio what is the iformatio example oe okay example oe you are watchig a TV you are watchig a TV okay ow you say you say to your kid your kid this is a TV this is your TV ow because the kid is a huma beig huma he ca uderstad he ca uderstad what you say ad he will uderstad some patters you will uderstad some patters what is the patters first patter it is a rectagular box it is a rectagular box secod patter some color colors are there obviously i the TV some show is ruig colors will be there right some colors are there ad third poit some cartoo people also there you'll uderstad the cartoos you do't kow about Shahrukh Kha you do't kow what Salma Kha is comig i the TV right he will simply uderstad the cartoos so these patters he ca uderstad that meas he uderstads the patters he's ot a system his erve system is uderstadig the patters that is we are talkig about euros owadays i the Deep learig ow secod example ow secod example you wet to the theater you wet to the theater or Mall to watch a movie to watch a movie ow ask a questio to your kid ow ask a questio to your kid ask a questio your kid what is this what is this ow based o his patters what is his patters his rectagular box theater screeigs rectagular box yes some colors are goig yes some cartoos are goig yes the what is you'll say aswer he will say mama this is a TV ow you will say o it is wrog it is wrog it is ot a TV it is a theater the he will uderstad he will add the fourth patter okay it's a big scree some big rectagular scree is there big rectagular scree is there so that he will uderstad okay if it is a small rectagular box is there it is a TV if it is a big rectagular box is there it is a theater ow ask the third example ow watch movie i laptop watch movie i laptop ad ask the questio what is this ow he already kow about the small thig is Stevia ad big thig is rectagular that is a theater he will either because he is a huma beig he ca uderstad the patter he will either say he either say TV or say theater because he kows he is a huma beig the same thig how you are traied the iformatio how you are traied the iformatio how this guy is uderstadig the patters if that iformatio you are testig with ew data textig with ew data ow you are uderstadig whether he ca say right aswer or wrog aswer if it is say right you are happy your model is good if it is wrog agai you are tradig with ew data so that's where that's where the machie learig will applicable actually so that's what is patters how our huma beig i midset we are discussig about patters i the same way the mathematics also will discuss the patters the mathematics will geerate the patters ow if you see here we are sedig a traied data we are creatig some ml algorithm the model is created ow i the same way you are providig you are a TV you are providig a theater ow you are askig a questio what is this he might be predicted somethig so that predictio you will do evaluate whether he say good okay if you say wrog agai you eed to trai with the dose data so that way machie learig all Gardes will works I hope those who are do't kow about machie learig ow we ca some extet he ca kow about the what is machie learig right ca I say yes or o i the chart you ca give me replay i the chat also I ca pass oe miute yeah thak you so ext ext we have some types of learigs will be happeed because there are so much data is there right ad the data is a huge data will be there so that's why what they are doig machie learig people they are dividig some types i that oe type is called supervisor learig supervisor learig ad aother type is called usupervised learig oe more type is called reiforcemet learig it is very easy guys supervisor learig meas suppose you have a use cases there i the use case you have some iput data is there ad output data is there so what is iput data ad what is output data ow comig to this Bak data suppose suppose you go here so this is a bak data some loa ID is there some geder is there educatio is there self-employed applicat icome loa amout loa amout term is there ad loa status so what is the objective of this data you eed to idetify the customer whether we ca grat a loa him or ot that is objective the objective is so for this loa IDK 1002 what is the status yes you are grated a loa you are ot grated a loa okay so these kid of data if you see that meas this loa ID geder educatio employed these are we ca say iput colums what we ca say iput colums ad what you are seeig loa status we ca say this is output colum because you wat to predict somethig so tomorrow I am goig with my ID I am a male cadidate I am a graduate I am ot a self-employed ad the my applicat icome is there so whether he ca provide the loa or ot that meas i the data you have some iput data will be there ad output that I will be there if you see that kid of thig we ca say this is a supervisor learig we ca say so I have see some participats raise their hads but I will pass i Middle you ca ask your questio i the chat at the time I will defiitely aswer okay ow ext uder the shoe I kow we got what is supervised learig here so I'll just give a example here Super Wise to the learig supervised learig meas we have some iput data will be there iput data will be there ad correspodig we have output database also will be available output data but agai i the iput data ad output you have a supervised learig i that supervisor learig agai we have oe more techique is called classificatio classificatio techique ad secod oe is we ca say regressio techique classificatio regressio what is the geeral Eglish meaig of classificatio guys what the geeral meaig of Eglish class meaig classificatio you are classified somethig classified somethig okay you are you are classificatio somethig like s or o some zoes like support covet Joes owadays Kobe Joes what is that gree zoe gree zoe orage Zoe Red Zoe some classificatio some parts are fail pass or fail these are the classificatio so here i the data here loa status is y is there ad loa status is o is there s is there o is there it is a classificatio so first questio is do we have output data yes do we have output data if thus output data is a categorical or ot ow ext questio is if that output data output data is i the form of categorical categorical some Eglish ames categorical the it is called classificatio techique simple so ow I will a questio this is a supervisor learig or ot this data is a supervised learig or ot yes it is a supervised learig how ca we are sayig it has iput data is there ad it has output data also there so it is a supervised learig ext questio it is a classificatio problem or regressio problem ow check the output if output is a categorical data of umerical data output is a categorical data so it is a classificatio problem ow oe more example I will take ow here my objective is predict the total umber of sales based o the advertisemet cost o differet medium I have a ower of some so so I am a ower of D Mart okay I wat to icrease my sales so what I decided I wat to sped some moey o some advertisemet advertisig so I sped some moey o TV ad ewspaper ad social media I wat to predict my sales if I sped this much what is my sales 2000 if I sped this much what is my sales it is a 1950 so first of all do you idetify the iput here what is your iput colums here TV ewspaper social media what is your output colum sales ow tell me it is a supervised learig or ot yes it is a supervised learig but if this your output is a umerical data or categorical data it is a umerical data ow output is output is a umerical data umerical data so if it is a umerical data the that model we called regressio model what is the model called regressio model so that is the supervised learig that is the first oe ad ext oe if you see here ext oe is called usupervised learig usupervised learig so usupervised learig is very simple guys supervised learig we are seeig some output data is there i the usupervised learig we do't have output data very simple we do't have output data what is the example for that ow see here the example for this this is called the objective is segmet or group the customers based o the aual icome ad spedig source ow you are a d Mart ower ow you have some customer IDC is there their age is there their geder is there ad the aual icome also there ad the spedig scores every moth the customers are comig to your market ad they are spedig somethig moey ad you are givig some spedig score based o the spedig score you wat to idetify whether they are a rich customers or poor customers they are importat customers are ot importat customers you wat to group them so here there is o output data your our use case is I wat to segmet the people I wat to divide the people how may people are my rich customers how may people are my poor customers I wat to divide those groups so that's why it is called it is a usupervised learig so that is the thig ad what you are seeig is called some algorithms like I said machie learig is developed by mathematics so that mathematics we are callig ml algorithms so agai machie learig is to divide it to three parts supervised ad usupervised so uder supervise you have some classificatio problem is there ad you have regressio problem is safe so classificatio meas you have a output data that is the step oe ad ext that output data is categorical the go for these may algorithms decisio trees Navi bias svm do't worry about these algorithms okay but just uderstad the high level View uderstad the high level view first of all machie learig is mathematics simple I will give you a fuy example I'll see you at this you have a data is there whe X is equal to 1 Y is equal to oe X is equal to Y is equal to 4 X is equal 3 Y is equal to 9 x equal to 4 Y is equal to 16 whe I say x is equal to 20 what Y is equal to tell me what is the Y is equal to put i you are aswerig the chart I just wat to see your yeah very good 400. how did you say this 400 how did you say this 400 because i your mid you created some mathematics equatio that is called Y is equal to x square this is ml algorithm guys this is a simple ml algorithm based o the previous data based o the previous data you predicted oe ml algorithm the you are sedig this x is equal to 20 to this algorithm it is givig Y is equal to 400 simple that's it ow thik about imagie as a big data is there for the Big Data you eed some calculus ad algebra mathematics we will develop some mathematical equatio like this so those mathematical algorithms we have give some ames that's all but mathematics is very simple mathematics that we are usig that is algebra algebra ad calculus all geographical so oly simple mathematics we are ot doig ay itegratio or differetiatio that we are ot usig here simple algebra ad calculus we will develop some ml models I hope people should uderstad ow what is exactly ml model meas this is your history data you created a ml model ow so ow people already created some more ml models by usig some mathematics we are usig that ow these are the some usupervised learig algorithms ad supervised learig algorithms do't worry about algorithms agai I am sayig that algorithms is othig but some mathematics simple algorithms is othig but a mathematics ow comig to the reiforcemet learig reiformig is geerally aget agets should respod with our actios like iPhoe Siri okay iPhoe series is a hey Siri what is the time ow if you say us it will give us some time right so that is a reiforcemet learig so ow robotic self-drivig cars Alexa these are the reiforcemet learig Earth Gardes so that's why we call so so I called AI owadays yeah ow if you see i 2019 I thik i 2019 our ISRO uh do for magala 2. okay that is for the moo they actually should lad at some place but due to the evirometal coditio it is ladig some other place that's why it is failed here whe it is ladig it is ot able to Ladig successfully because the evirometal coditios is ot able to respod that aget so they implemeted the AI coditio i the ISRO eviromet but obviously the moo coditios is differet there's a rocket sciece it's ot a easy task so that's why we got some failure but is 95 success that is so like that way the reiforcemet learig owadays the so much moey they are spedig o this reiforcemet learig so this is about the machie learig ad the types guys so I will give oe pass here okay I will give oe pass ad all the cluster algorithms are usupervised algorithms yes you are correct all cluster algorithms are called usupervised learig clusterig othig but groupig or segmetatio your characterizatio if you have ay doubts you ca ask me I will give oe miute we do't kow cluster what is oe me we do't kow cluster how to pursue this course yeah this is a data sciece course that will be talk about maagemet okay yeah yes that is aother city that is our mai evet we'll talk about this all these thigs but at least you ca idetify the high level view right what is machie learig what is data sciece everythig yeah the you ca easily lear about cluster algorithms that is that you ca say ext what is the reiforcemet Ledig yeah course cotet I will that admi will take care of okay that is ot our Workshop thig okay ow okay we'll go to the ext thig that admi will take that first you uderstad the cocept ed to ed flow agai at the ed we will discuss about your doubts okay but i the middle I wat to kow the specific questios that is related to your Cocepts ow some people are algorithm reiforcemet learig algorithm they are askig so reiforce rederig algorithms is completely a algorithms okay that is you ca kow huggig phase Trasformers there's a example that is we ca say huggig phase Trasformers or robotics or Trasformers are there there is a call huggig face Trasformers okay huggig face huggig face or you ca say YOLO there's a YOLO algorithm is there you look oly oce okay you look oly oce you ca test type YOLO you will idetify image objects for self-drivig cars or movig objects they will idetify like this there are some algorithms so ext this is a very very importat guys what is a data sciece life cycle what is a data sese life cycle so of course I told you agai I leared mathematics Islad everythig I wat to implemet the programmig laguage I eed required is pytho okay those who are learig about pytho it is a very good course agai I am sayig that why this is pytho is a tool pytho is a tool pytho is a tool but data sciece is a subject it is a subject okay cyber security cyber security is a subject okay iot is a subject I what is a subject like that ad cloud computig cloud computig is a subject okay cloud computig subject those who are learig the tools my best advice is lear ay oe of the subjects so that you ca master that subject ad there's a so much lifespa i the IIT carrier okay pytho is a tool those who are learig pytho the best choice is data sciece that is ed to ed you ca kow that so ext so data sciece life cycle guys this is the data so ay data sciece lifecycle ot all ay data sciece lifecycle guys suppose you I am a you are a data scietist I am a customer I am some HDFC Bak okay I'm HDFC Bak customer I wat to kow that my customer home loa capacity so first ad most importat is what you eed to uderstad about busiess problem okay first of all what is your problem is the HDFC bak is comig to you ad they will have some help for you the first what is that you eed to uderstad about busiess problem what is your problem oce you uderstad the problem oce you uderstad the problem you eed to collect the data the HDFC bak will provide data to you hfc bak will provide the data to you ext this data might be a structured data or ustructured data data might be a structured data or ustructured data so this data might be a structured way or ustructured way okay ow what you will do you will make a data preparatio you make the data ito structured way or you are puttig ito some database ad ready to use some database you will make ito some database you are load all this data to the i this database ad the data is ready oce data is ready this is the heart of data sciece guys we call Eda exploratory data aalysis exploratory data aalysis what you will do i the data aalysis you will uderstad some isights uderstad some isight what is the iside what is the mea value what is the media value what is the mode what is the variace how it is goig the all statistical Cocepts what is the populatio how the sample is workig ad what is the hypothesis this is all a statistical Cocepts if you remember your childhood days we kow our statistics right so based o the statistics you eed to idetify based o statistics we eed to idetify Idetify some patters Idetify some patters we eed to idetify that so that's why EDI is a very very importat ad the oce EDI is doe we will develop our ml models so called mathematics models ml models you you said sir I created a model okay you said home cursor I created a model but how ca I kow your model is good or ot how ca you kow your Y is equal to x square is a good correct model or ot you developed a y is equal to x square ad you said Assad this is my model verify this how ca I verify by usig model evaluatio whether your model is correct or wrog I eed to do the modal evaluatio the fially your model is ready ad I eed to deploy your model deploymets what this HDFC bak I should use right you created your model here but HDFC bak I should use that is a model deploymet so this is a data sciece lifecycle guys you eed to uderstad the busiess problem data collectio data preparatio the step by step o eed to buy heart also this is this is commo sese I eed to uderstad the problem ext I eed to thik about solutio for to thik about solutio I eed some resources here resources is the data sciece I have data is there I eed to prepare the data i the orgaized way I data is prepared I eed to do some statistical aalysis because my duty is that data sciece duty is oly to uderstad the patters ow I eed to create a model my model is doe ow I wat to verify this model is good or ot that's the evaluatio the I eed to deploy the model because HDFC bak I should use ow data sciece is completed with this ow you created a model ow you created a model thik like this you created created a model I will take Y is equal to x square oly because that you created from your mid just ow okay I'm just kiddig but why is equal to sphere your model you created that model Y is called x square ow HDFC Bak should use that model HDFC Bak should use that model okay this Y is equal to x square you created a model by usig pytho code by usig pytho code is created by usig pytho code ow pytho code you ru i your local pytho code you ru i your local ow how ca HDFC guy use that how ca HDFC I use your model that is the questio umber oe questio umber oe how ca a cliet we ca call cliet use your model so this we are i IT idustry the term called productio okay what would be the term is called productio how ca a cliet use your model i the productio level how ca a cliet use your model i the productio level ad secod questio the cliet is sayig cliet is sayig that sayig that every moth every moth I will geerate geerate a ew data ew data how ca your model respod how ca your model respod o the ew data ad I should write my questio first you created Y is equal to x square ow how ca you had over to the cliet the productio level ext cliet is sayig that every moth I will geerate a ew data how ca your model is respod ow ext third questio is how ca you moitor you ca say moitor or track your model performace modal performace tell me these three questios that's it I'm good so this is your local everythig is your local but how ca you aswer this all questios so that's where we comig mlogs machie learig operatios ow see here after model developmet after model developmet we eed to ask some questios ourselves first questio is how ca we had over a developed model to cliet which meas how ca we deploy our model o productio level that is the first questio valid questio right this is a very valid questio because your model is developed i a local system i my computer I developed but how ca I had over to the cliet it's a valid questio ow how ca we trai our model agai o the fresh data ow oe like customers are comig i this moth April ad two lakh customers are comig i the Jue ow your model you your pytho code should be geeralized code right that code should trai o the ew data so that is the ext questio how ca we trai our model o fresh data i future o productio level ow third questio how ca we moitor or track our model performace ow this moth April moth oe lakh customers are there I created a model Y is equal to x square is my model my model performace is good I am gettig accuracy is equal 90 percet ow after Jue 2 lakhs customers are comig ow if your model is traiig o the fresh data Maybe your model is performace will drop 70 percet will come how ca you moitor or track the model performace so these are the all valid questios i the Cloud eviromet whe we are trasferrig ito the cliet productio level so there oe more thig is called how ca we maitai the ed-to-ed flow from data igestio to predictio like I told you right data is there ijectio ad you eed to do predictio so from here to Here There Is the Ed to Ed flow is there how ca you maitai this ed-to-ed flow for cliet so where to aswer all about questios our best practice is ml Ops ow see the sceario i the two ways guys oe is developig a model is oe way ad productio as the model is aother way productio level okay developed a model is a data sciece people will do so to do the Productios ml egieerig I will do ml egieerig very simple ml egieerig so I will say I will tell you a beautiful thig ow i the AI world of AI rules i the world of Errors there are three kigs are there first oe is the data egieer guy what data egieer guy will do cliet will come HDFC bak will put some data ito somewhere okay ow the data egieer respod is you eed to igest the data to make use of the data sciece okay that is the data egieer guy so I'm a data egieer my respose is what HDFC bak is givig a data to me I wats to put the data ito i the Some Cloud eviromet some database or SQL Microsoft SQL Server so that data sciece guy ca use the data that is a data egieer guy so this is a base level oe ow data is ready i the cloud data is ready i the database data is ready i the database okay the data sciece will come so what this value guy do you will uderstad the patters ad you will created a ml models it will create a ml models these are data sciece guy o third there is a ml egieer what this guy's respose is he will make use of this ml model to the cliet i the productio level cliets should use productio level so these are all importat people i the world of AI without these guys data egieer data scietist ad we ca say ml egieer so these three guys are very very importat so some maybe the model developmet does't kow about this guy okay the model developmet does't kow about this guy this guy kows model developmet this guy kow how to make ito productio okay but as a good idea guy we eed to kow about how the data sciece algorithms will work ad how the ml egieer should work ow yeah I hope you uderstood right the rules how the roles are distiguished data egieer will igest the data data scietists will do develop the model ml egieer will do productioize the model so this is the rules of i the three people so you ca say ml Ops is a level three level three so I will just show you here for you make you easy I will just write here step oe igest the data step two develop ml models step 3 make use the ml models i the productio eviromet the productio eviromet so this guy is a data egieer guy this guy is a data sciece guy ad this guy is a ml egieer guy MLG so where our ml Ops will come to here everyoe else will come to here so data egieer guys Place data sciece guys will closely work each other closely work each other ow data sciece guys plus ml egieerig guys will closely work to each other closely work each other but they were igestig a data idustry data is a very hectic task okay there are so may people will requiremet here much people eeded here much people eeded here i the same way MLG Egieerig also much people required here because puttig i the productio level is ot a easy task okay so that's why I always remember data sciece ad MLG is the part this both combiatio if you kow about data sese ad MLG the you will lead the idustry you ca lead IIT easily data sciece ad MLD o I kow I hope you have some broad picture ow but I just wat to repeat agai I just wat repeat agai so we have started with our machie learig what is about machie learig ad we kow about types of machie learig ad we kow about data sese life cycle ad after model developmet what is the questios you eed to ask yourself ad the for to all these questios to aswer we go for MLS okay ow good high up till ow you uderstad right everythig the high level flow ca I expect yes yeah to uderstood the high level flow yeah the questios I will take I will aswer all the questios do't worry guys because this sessio is for you oly okay this sectio is especially we are set up for you oly to clear all your high level doubts clarificatios we'll take olie offlie also both yeah we'll talk that at the ed okay ow see ml Ops is the full form is called machie learig operatios that is clear what is mL of score fuctio is machie learig is focused o machie learig models through the productio that oly I am tellig right machie learig models to the productio ad the you eed to maitai ad you eed to moitor very simple guys you eed to put that i the productio ad moitor so mL of is a collaborative fuctio of a data scietist guys ad devops guys it's a combiatio thak God I am workig some mL of project so eve though I'm a data scietist so that I kow about ed to ed flow so I very much thak to God because I have your opportuity to work with ML Ops also because I do't wat stick as a guy with oly I kow models I kow the iterest I wat to kow about ed to ed flow you should be ethusiasm like that so that's why we are here to teach you ow why we eed mlos ow you already have a aswer why you eed MLS because machie learig life cycle is a very complex life cycle you eed to igest the data you eed to apply Eda you eed to do feature egieerig you eed to do the model traiig you eed to about model performace you eed to the predictios you eed to deploymet moitorig ad you eed to do the automated model traiig that is there's so may life cycles are there but these life cycles are trust me guys you ca ejoy this you ca ejoy literally if you kow about this data sciece ad ml Ops you will ejoy the life you ca you oly do the so much work because these all are r d this is all our r d it is ot like a daily routie toss it's ot agai like a rotat us it is like a complete R ad a research ad developmet we are i that so you kow about why we eed mlos ow this where is a very very importat thig guys mL of ed-to-ed workflow first two step is what ml developmet ext ml developmet you eed to create a traiig operatios what is the traiig operatios I will tell you so i ml developmet after ml developmet that meas I ca say ml developmet here step oe ml developmet is there what is ml developmet you will do you will do data igestio you will do okay data igestio you do you will do data preparatio you will do ow you should't you should say the steps ow okay you do data preparatio you will do Eda ad you will do model buildig model buildig ad you will do evaluatio this is all your steps you do data igestio data preparatio Ada model buildig evaluatio we will do that's clear this everythig you will make oe setup guys you will make create a DOT py file dot py file ad some cofig file some cofig file you will create some dot py file some cofig file what is cofig file I hope I ca show you that give me oe miute give me oe miute guys I ca show you the some cofig file so this is a cofig file you see this is the cofig file I have created what is the Q a maker Commuity Services what is the storage Services what is auto complete Services I'm creatig some ames so that I ca use my pytho code okay do't do't worry about Do't Paic about that okay I just wat to show you that what is the cofig files okay what is your ID ad how ca you use that what is your suppose this what is your cotaier ame what is that's my ame is ladig what is your uh storage accout ame these all are some cofig files we are creatig so oce you created your ml everythig you will create some dot py files some cofig file so that is the step oe you eed to do that is othig but your traiig operatios are ready why traiig operatios are ready the cliet is already said cliet is already said every moth he will get you will get a ew data you will get a ew data how ca you trai that you eed to create a automated pipelie right you could eed to create a automated pipelie that pipelie should do what data igestio should do the compoet oe compoet two compoet 3 compoet 4 compoet five these five compoets you eed to create a pipelie so that you ca cotiuously you ca cotiuously cotiuously trai the model trai the model o ew data so this is we ca say CET cotiuous traiig so that's why we eed to create this dot previous cofig files so you create you writte data igestio oe fuctio call data preparatio is aother fuctio call Eda is aother fuctio call model buildig is aother fuctio called evaluatio is aother fuctio call ow total five fuctio calls are called Phi compoets five compoets you created a pipelie you created a pipelie ad that pipelie what it will do every time a ew data will come it will do the same task it will do the same task data igestio data preparatio Ed every time it will do so this is the traiig operatios the code ad cofig we will do what it will do cotiuous traiig it will do after traiig operatios what it will happe cotiuous traiig by usig called traiig pipelie so oe traiig is doe you eed to deploy your model by usig call with register a model ad the we will do the oe the model deploy what is the usig you eed to serve right you eed to predictio whether I ca give the loa or ot whe I we ca I ca uh I ca group the customers or ot Productios by usig a servig package ad fially you eed to moitor that by usig all servig logs so these are the steps very simple you kow what is the first step model developmet ad secod step this is the hard math this is the heart of machie learig cotiuous traiig because ew data is comig I wat to do the cotiuous traiig after traiig is happeed I eed to do the model deploymet after deploymet is happeig I eed to do the serve the I eed to do the moitor I eed to do the moitor I'll give oe example here I'll give oe example here you will uderstad with that example ow suppose you wat to sed you wat to sed a courier a courier to your fried okay Courier or package career or package to your fried you lives i Hyderabad who lives i Hyderabad ad your fried lives i Delhi your fried your fried lives i lives i Delhi so uderstad this example is very very importat guys what you will do step oe what you will do tell me what you will do you will go to The Courier Service you will go to the Courier Service Courier Service ad register ad register a your ame register your ame ad Courier you will register this the step two so after register what you will do you will keep you will keep your package your package i The Courier office Courier office ad step three they will give they will give oe trackig ID they will give oe track ID trackig ID so that you ca track you ca track you ca track ow step four thik like that this you wat to sed you wat to sed aother package aother package i ext moth i ext moth so what will happe this is this moth is package umber oe ad ext moth is package umber two ad ext moth is package umber three some distiguish package umber oe packet umber two package umber three some distiguish will be there ow step five step five your fried should use ed user your fried use use that package fried use that package so these are these life cycle Ma these are the etire life cycle about the package thig ow this we will opt our ml Ops okay ready with dust ow importat steps eed to cosider mL of software model developmet your Courier you are goig to The Courier office ad you are register your package that meas you developed a model you wat to register your model that is called Model registry you register your package the you are keepig your package i The Courier office I register my model ext step is I wat to deploy my model deploymet is the ext step ow you said I wat to repeat this task that is the package umber oe package umber two package umber three ow o the ew data is a model created that is model umber oe i the ext moth it's the model umber two ad ext moth is the model umber three that is called modal versioig ad you wat to track your model that is the performace modal versioig is othig but model 1.0 Model 2.0 ad fially you wat to ed user what is your use case fially so this is a complete mL of steps guys model registry model deploymet model trackig model versioig model iferece so this is the complete mL of theory I hope you uderstood that mL of Siri okay model registry model deploymet model trackig model versioig I will tell you how ca we register the model that is the Practical we will see ow what happeed to shamai i oe miute guys yeah sorry guys yeah thak you ah ow you ad I hope you uderstood about ml Ops ad everythig ow what is the Practical sessio okay let's go to the Practical sessio ow but agai with that I'm repeatig agai what we have doe I'll just go to the my our slides previous slides the steps I eed to do machie learig cocept types of machie learig data sciece life cycle what is mL of why we use mL of ad mL of Cetral ad flow we have doe this ow with this I hope you uderstood about machie learig those who already kow they ca uderstad that I kow very well okay but there are two two types of guys right those who already do't kow about data sciece machie learig I hope you already kow about high level View ad those who already kow about motio learig you kow about how ml Ops is workig that is ow with this we will go for practical implemetatio so for this practical implemetatio I just wat to use here Google collab otebook Google collab otebook Okay Google collab otebook we wat to use that is why we use Google collab otebook why we use Google collab otebook so Google corrupt otebook is a free service pre-service is offerig the Google otebook Jupiter otebook kid of it is there are may two thigs guys oe is if it is a huge big data will be available if it is a huge big data will be available ow Google collab otebook is offerig from 25 GB data 25 GB data so that there is a huge data also you ca process also also it ca give oe GPU access ad TPU access oe GPU access ad TPU access ad secod oe is secod oe is ml Ops geerally is related to the cloud eviromet okay Geeral it is a cloud aime you wat to register a model right you wat to deploy a model that we will use the cloud so the cloud packages istallig Cloud packages istallig Cloud packages istallatio is tricky is tricky whe you i your local otebooks i your local Jupiter otebook so this is easy this is easy easy i Google collab otebook I like this actually because geerally we usually work o the cloud packages so whe we istall i the local Red it is ot at all istalled properly okay we eed to create a virtual eviromet s ad all this thig we eed to see so that's why it is easy i the Google collab otebook so we'll ope a Google collab otebook ow go to here just type Google collab just type Google collab ad the it is a ow it's a Google there's a ew otebook optio will be there click o the ew otebook click o the ew otebook ow here i the top you see right Utitled 3 13 so I just wat right here mL of workflow mL of workflow that is I'm give a ame here i the top okay reame The Notebook so to work o the Google collab otebook guys you eed to coect here the optio there is a coect is there you eed to iteret you eed to coect this that is the coectio it is a coectig so we'll take some i time because go to iteret issues or because of Iteret fast it will go to that iitializatio ad coect that ow secod step is you eed to coect ow it will give some Ram how much RAM it is 12.27 poit GB that is there ow I told you right we have oe GPU ad oe TPU is there go to rutime ow you have a chage rutime type ad there is a GPU is there ad TPU is there so the GPU is there ad TPU is there so if it is a big data you ca use that if it is ot big data do't use that that is ot a issue ad your file is there ad code optio is there text optio is there the beauty of Google collab otebook is it is ca work as a text Word documet you ca write some mathematics you ca write some images ad you ca do the code also that is the beauty of this okay so GPU ad TPU actually wheever you wat to use that right wheever the big data is at to speed up the process to speed up the process we have GPU ad we have TPU is there okay GPU ad TPU like suppose you have a big data is there you have a big data is there wheever you have a big data you eed to process very fast right wheever you wat to very fast you wat to process that we have local we have what CPU will be available locally we have CPU will be available well like four CPUs or three CPC level but GPU is a graphical Processig Uit geerally will speed up your process speed of your process to load suppose thik like that your data set your data set has oe 10 lakh observatio or 1 millio observatios 1 millio observatios to load 1 millio observatios how much time it will take i local how much time it will take local how much time will take i Google collab otebook that is the thig i collab otebook we have a GPU access ad we have a TPU access so that it we ca read very fast it ca read very fast it will be very slow so I ca say CPU is the lowest table GPU is highest level ad TPU is the very fast TPU is a very fast okay so if you wat the CPU this is the key iside GPU I ca use our ame TP is othig but tesor tesor processig uit GP is othig but graphical graphical processig uit ad uiverse if you write what is CPU cetral processig uit Cetral processig uit okay ow we are goig to here agai ow I wat to do my ml Ops here I just wat right here ml offs okay so my my I just write the otes also that is a beauty I like this Jupiter otebooks because you ca write the uh story also ot oly story like I ca do the image also okay I'm goig to here suppose MLS so I'm just takig oe image okay I just wat to show you this image which image I wat to take okay this image I will take ow go to the ispect ad there's a image okay the image is there right you are seeig that image go to the edit as HTML just copy this ad come to here go to the text ad Page this see image is comig ow that's the beauty you ca do the mathematics also like this you ca create the mathematics also okay ow step oe step oe step oe is ay ay ay pack ay code if you wat right you eed to istall a required packages istall required packages istall a required packages ow what is the packages we will use is we will use we wat to istall some packages so I will just display the packages ames here so here we will use a umpy package ad padas package ad sql package ad ml flow package okay umpy package used for what is a umerical pytho umerical pytho it is used for mathematics used for mathematics ad padas package user for data frame ad data aalysis sql package is used for machie learig algorithms machie learig algorithms ow ml flow is the ml flow is our ml operatios platform mlos platform MLS platform ow we'll see what is ml flow ow we'll just write here ml flow so ml flow is a platform for machie learig life cycle ow it is a ml Price look like this i the slow lae ow i the few miutes you will get to kow about what is this the latest versio is 2.2.2 it is a cloud package it is a cloud package we eed to istall this so this is default it will be there default default pytho it will be there o eed to istall ad here also this is padas also o eed to istall o eed to istall ad SQL ad also o eed to istall ml flow is the cloud package we eed to istall this okay ml flow is we eed to istall that first ml flow is there or ot there you just apply like this exclamatory Mark ml flow exclamatory Mark ml flow if you ru this if it is istalled you will get some to see somethig if it is ot istalled you will see commad ot foud okay you will see commad ot foud so that meas it is ot istalled so we will istall ow that is PIP istall ml flow simple if istall ml flow ow just istall this pip istall ml flow ow very good it is istalled so what it is istalled mac o databricks docker git database git pytho ad where is our ml flow here is ml flow you see right versus 2.2.2 ow the same thig we will ru here ml flow it is istalled ow so you will see somethig like this before what happeed if it is ot istalled you'll see commad ot foud after istallatio you ca see the some iformatio right this is good ow ext if you wat to see the versio also ow if you wat to see the versio ml flow versio so the latest versio is what 2.2.2 ow the same thig we have see here 2.2 it is released i 14th March oly so MLS is doe ow ext thig is import required packages I hope you clear the first poit right everyoe we istall a package i the step oe we istall a package i the step oe ow step two foreig what is that import required packages import required packages first package is import umpy as NP import ERS SP ow ow sql model ow I wat to give the iformatio here ow here I wat to use I wat to use a regressio model okay I wat to use a regressio model ame called elasticet the model ame is what elastic et model this is a model ame guys it is a regressio model you already kow what is the regressio model right regressio model is a supervised algorithm algorithm supervisor algorithm that meas we have iput will be there ad output will be there but output is output is i umerical data output is umerical data for this we ca use regressio algorithms that you already kow that is so what model I wat to use I wat to use a regressio model what is the ame of the model elasticet so ame of the model is elastic et data set I am takig is called wie quality data wie quality data what the data set ame is called wie quality data that meas I will tell you I will show the data set ad I will tell you what is your wie quality data ad platform we are usig Google collab otebook Google collab otebook ad the objective is here is objective what is your mai target is we eed to predict predict the quality of the quality of the wie so that is the data set ame is called wie quality data ad the model ame is called elastic et this is clear so ow from skl dot liear model dot liear model import elastic et will come automatically yeah elastic et that is doe ext from skl dot model selectio dot model selectio import trai test split I will tell you what is the tred test split I will tell you ext I wat to evaluate my model also right for that from skl dot matrix import these are some metrics these are some metrics mea absolute error mea squared error ad some R to score Do't Paic ow okay these are the some metrics those already kow about regressio aalysis they kow very well those who do't kow also do't eed to paic oce you lear you will easily uderstad oly thig is this will give your model performace okay if this will give your moral performace that's why we are sayig what metrics ad this is a skeleto is a package iside we have a liear model iside we have a elastic et agai sql is the package iside we have a model selectio ad we are importig trai test split I will tell you what is the strai test split ext oe is import ml flow ad we ca say import ml flow dot SK learig so these are my packages it is istalled ow step two is istall the packages is doe we are good at step two also right we are good at step two also yeah ow step three step three read the data read the data step three is read the data ow to read the data if you see here the file locatio is their files just click o this files ow you will see some Arrow will be there wheever you click o the files you will see some Arrow ow if you click o the Arrow I have some data sets will be there here I have wie quality red is there I am importig the data so ow the data is there why i quality red agai I'm repeatig guys we have some files locatio is there click o the files locatio click o the up Arrow it will redirect to your locatios okay ow iside we have oe data set will be there I uploaded that data ow I will read my data I will read my data ow data equal to PD dot read CSV PD dot read CSV I eed to provide the path iside I eed to provide the path there the three dots will be there here there are three dots will be there go to here there's a copy path will be available copy path ow copy that ad come to here ad ow apply data dot head it will give top five rows ow see this is my data it is my data fixed acidity volatile acidity citric acid these all are some chemical ames ow we have a Target is what called quality is our Target quality is our Target variable quality so these all are iput data sets ad this is our output colum it is a supervised learig ad it is a regressio problem it is a supervised supervised learig ad it is a regressio problem as simple as that ow just uderstad the data what are the colums are there o see first we'll uderstad how may rows ad how may colums are there that is give data dot shape so there are 149 ad rows are there ad 12 colums are there what it will give the iformatio this data set ad 12 colums are there 12 colums are there so i that 12 colums 11 colums are iput colums iput colum that is X ad oe colum that is what is the colum ame quality what is the colum ame quality ow quality is output colum output you ca say Target colum we geerally deoted by small y okay so we have 1 5 9 ad of course ad 12 colums i the 12 11 colums are iput colums ad oe colum is called is very good it is a regressio problem because we have quality is umerical data okay why it is a regressio problem quality is a target output colum output colum has umerical data umerical data so that's why it is called regressio yes very good umerical colum ow you got the poits very good that is excellet ow data dot shape ow that is completed ow you ca see data dot colums also i the quick way so our iterest is we are ot doig ay EDI here our iterest is to deploy model o the mloffs what is our iterest is our iterest is model developmet model developmet ad deploymet to develop a model to develop a model make sure we have all the colums all the colums have umerical data why umerical data mathematics math works oly o umbers oly o umbers so if ay categorical data is there we eed to covert ito umerical so first we will check where the umerical data is there or ot for that data.ifo will apply data.ifo ow it will see all our types of float float float o umerical ode categorical data all our umerical data we are put ad there's o ull values also see all our ormal it is a colum umber called fixed acidity umber is 159 error rows ad it is a o ull values ad data type is float 64. we are good you ca check this also data dot is ull dot sum if ay ull values is there for the correspodig colum wise it will give the sytax so we do't have ay ull values so we are good we do't have ull values ad we have the data is umerical way so we ca create our model developmet that is a step four ow step four step four just write like this model developmet usig ml flow ow here I wat to show you how the model developmet Geeral will happe okay so step oe is this is a very very importat step guys we eed to uderstad this is okay what I am tellig you is ow importat everyoe should uderstad first we divide we divide data ito two parts two parts oe is traied oe is traied data ad aother oe is test data okay we divide i two parts oe is traied data ad aother is test data ad secod is trai data as iput ad output tested data also as iput ad output agai we divide we divide traied data trai data ito iput data ad okay iput data ad output that meas iput colum separately output colums operatig so that we ca say exit trai ad wide trai simple we divided iput colum separately ad output colums separately ad the the same way we divide test data ito X test data ad Y test data first of all trai data data device data ad test data both havig iput colums ad output colums so we are separatig ito Excel trai y trai XO test ad Y test ad the model developmet model developmet happes o trai data o traied data model developmet will happe o trai data so ext step is model developmet will happe traied data the oce your model is created you eed to test right so I wat to model test so I wat to model predictios model predictios happes o X test data accept test data so this will give this will give y predictios very simple guys I have created my model the I wat to check my model is performed well or ot so I will pass X test ad model it will give some values that is we are callig y predictios fially fially I will compare I will compare my y predictios with Y test why predictios why predictios with Y test so this is the etire flow ow I just wat to show you maybe for write up you will cofuse but I will show you ow here how it will happe just see origial data iput colums are X1 X2 XP output colum is y we divide ito four parts trai data test data agai trai data is extra trai while trai X test y test what does that mea thik like that you have a data is like this you have a data is like this X is oe two three four Y is oe four ie sixtee twety five First Step Oe is divide ito two parts trai data test data the exitrai y trai X test y test ow come here this is the tred at first three observatios is the trai data last two observatios are the test data so it is a trai data extra trai white trai test data is a last observatio XO test y test ow my model is applied o which data trai data so I created a model called Y is equal to x square ow I will pass 4 to the Y is equal to x square I will get a predictio called 16.\",\n",
       " \"I will pass Y is equal to Phi to the x square I will got the prestified so my predictios are what 16 ad 25 ow I will compare the 1625 already existed 16 ad 25 so this is the compariso so this is geerally ml developmet flow will happe I hope this is clear right uderstadig this is very very importat guys so you geerally divide the data that's it you geerally divide the data ito two parts that's the trai data ad test data ad agai EXO trai ad Y trai so to do to do all these thigs to do all these thigs we have trai test split Eglish ame Commo Sese Eglish commo Eglish ame trai test split it is a SK L package what is this sql package so what I will do is I will divide I will divide my data ito 70 30 ratio 70 30 ratio that meas out of 5159 observatios of 70 percet of 70 percet is my trai data okay out of 1599 observatios 30 percet is my test data ow ad also I will divide trai ad test data radomly I will divide radomly that meas the idea how will be like oe two three four five like this oe ad so oe five ie  will be there so I will divide the trai data I will pick first fifth observatio I will pick 10th observatio I'll pick 500 observatio radomly I will pick okay y will pick radomly to avoid the bias to avoid the bias what is mea by bias suppose u r a you are a fa of Virat Kohli okay you are a fa of Virat Kohli I will call you I will ask you who is your favorite cricketer what you will say you'll say Virat Kohli oly suppose Sharma ad I will ask you who who is your fa Roy Sharma you will say so if I pick you the bias this is the bias if I pick the radomly this output might be differet this output might be differet this output might be differet so Cosolidated my model will give that good output so that's why Always divide the data radomly do't go with order okay oe oe two thousad is a traied data trai data ad oe zero zero oe two sixtee hudred is a test data this will give the bias do't go like this first thousad observatio pick radomly secod 1600 observatio agai pick radomly so this we will do what we will do divide data ito 70 30 ratio ad pick the observatios i the radomly ow we will do that okay how we'll do that here so trai is oe test is aother oe so I will apply trai test split trai test split iside I eed to pass my data ad I eed to pass my test size is equal to 0.3 what is this mea we are dividig data ito sevety thirty percet ow I will apply radom state radom State equal to you ca give ay umber oe two three four you ca give oe two you ca give aythig you ca give radomly it will pick okay ow trai dot shape ad test dot shape okay ow see out of 159 observatios oe oe ie observatio is your trai data 480 observatios are your test data ow if I go for trai dot head trai.head I will see radomly it is speakig first of the reaso is what 642 secod observatio 678 third four oe two fourth oe sevety three good right these are great actually we are dividig ito 70 30 ad we are applyig radom so if we got divided traied data ad test data ow we eed to divide X to trai ad ow ow divide data ito EXO trai trai X ad trai y iput colum output colum separately we already kow ow trai X equal to out of this all the colums if I remove this quality if I remove this quality remaiig colums are what trai data remaiig colums are traied data so trai dot drop I am droppig a colum quality quality I'm droppig so it is a colum so we eed to give X is equal to 1. so that's the trai data i the same way test data Test X so test data dot drop agai same quality comma X is equal to 1. so we divided iput data i the trai data we divide we got the iput data ad test also we got the iput data ow we get the output oe trai why so out of this strai data if I select oly quality colum if I select oly quality colum that is my output data that is my output data so trai dot ow you ca select oly the quality that's it ow test Y is equal to test quality ow that's it we're doe ow you ca check your trai x dot shape dot shape ad trai y dot shape out of 12 colums 11 colums are iput colum ad oe colum is what output colum right see total trade observatios are triple oe ie i that 11 colums are your trai X ad oly oe colum is what trai y i the same way we have Test X ad test y dot shape four AIT is eleve that the test data ad oe colum is output data so we divided Tred test split is that clear rate till ow if radom state is 0 istead of pickig 642 it will pick aother value okay if you give aother radom state it will give you so how ca you pass suppose I am givig oe dot here if oe dot okay how may lies how may lies ca pass through oe dot tell me what is your aswer how may lies you ca pass through oe dot Ifiity yes like that radom State you ca give ay value it ca pick ifiite times maybe after 642 it will come after four oe two will come after 73 will come 678 will come last so wheever you chage this value the goal is fixed it will pick the radomly but the umbers will be differet that's all ow we'll go to the our mai step ow step fifth ow start ml flow step fifth start ml flow start ml flow yeah ext ml flow is a cloud algorithm ml flow is what ml flow is a cloud platform is a cloud platform ow what I my what is my task I wat to develop a model I wat to develop a model ad I wat to deploy I wat to deploy o ML flow oe he eed to deploy a ml flow ext suppose Abhishek Abhishek is created aother model oe agai you eed to create a you eed to deploy ml flow okay ow this yeah radom state that is a radom state is othig but agai I told you right it is a radomly it will pick that well radomly it will pick that that is a radom state okay I hope I give your aswer already yeah oe two three four that oly if I give radom State equal to oe two three four ow tell me like this oe comma 2 comma three comma four comma five six seve eight ie te ow radomly it will stop with oe after that how may combiatios will come secod letter how may combiatios secod letter will come how may combiatios third letter will come how may combiatio fourth letter will come radomly may right so that may we will provide by usig called radom state radom state if you give radom State equal to oe it will give oe order two three four like oe oe oe oe oe oe oe oe oe oe like this so wheever you chage your radom State the umbers will be chaged here that's why I am explaiig okay yeah so ext so uderstad this is guys this start ml flow is very very importat ow omkar creates oe model you wat to deploy a ml flow object created oe model he wats to display a ml flow that meas what ml flow will do ml flow will create some workspace some workspace for you some workspace i the ame of i the ame of experimet what is the ame here ame of experimet remember this ml flow will create some workspace i the ame of experimet so first we eed to create our experimet what we'll do first to create our experimet so that is ml flow dot set experimet set experimet I'm givig some path my path is ml flow ml flow ad you are givig mL of ml Ops workspace MLS workspace so this is my ame this is my workspace ame you ca create your ow workspace okay you ca give ay ame also you ca give arratio M also here okay you ca give your ame also that meas you are settig a experimet why you are settig your experimet there are thousads of people who ca create their model ad they wat to deploy a ml flow ml flow should uderstad what is your experimet ame what is your workspace ame that ml flow should uderstad that that's why we are creatig a experimet ame ow this experimet is ot there so you see here experimet with ame ml flow mL of workspace does ot exist so we are creatig ad this is your experimet ID ad this is the life stages active ad artifact locatio I will tell you what is artifact locatio it will go to this locatio this is the locatio path okay we'll just prit some values we'll just prit some values so prit I'll just copy this dot experimet ID I'm just givig experimet ID ad agai I am prit this because I wat to use that ID I wat to use that ID so life cycle stage is active agai prit ad you ca give ame also so if I prit all these three ow first oe is my experimet ID ame this is my experimet ID so ow this is your ID ow your workspace is active what is your workspace ame ml flow mL of workspace I hope this you clear ow right ca I get aswer i the chat box this is uderstadig is importat ml flow set experimet yeah code ow experimet is ready ow we'll go to the code ow we'll go to the code ow so I will create some fuctio call because I wat to write multiple times so what I will do is I will create some fuctio call So Def trai model deftrai model is my fuctio called ame so first step is what developed develop trai test split I wat to divide my data that I already show you how to divide the data so we'll just copy from there because we already did that so what I will do is I will take this I'm takig this this is I have doe separated to make you uderstad guys okay this add-o separated to make you uderstad because uderstadig that is very very importat ow this is we have take so this is importat so I just remove this I do't wat this okay ow your trai model is doe ow ow secod is iitiate the ml flow ow iitiate iitiate ml flow ow so we are iitiatig ow with ml flow dot start ru let us start ru is there ml flow dot start ru iside it is askig some experimet ID you eed to provide your experimet ID what is your ru ame okay you ca give your ame also ad you ca give a descriptio also so I am providig my experimet ID experimet ID what is my experimet ID so this is my experimet ID right this is my experimet ID comma my ru ame I wat to provide ru ame also that is it is a regressio it is a regressio ad I will provide the descriptio also it is a descriptio also I wat to provide what is the descriptio here aythig aythig you ca write performig a regressio aalysis so this all we ca see UI ow ml flow UI we ca see this all so this is the fuctio call so we are puttig colos here ad we are ruig this okay experimet ID a ru ame ad descriptio ow Now call ml model ow call ml model what is your ml model ame ml model ame is called elasticet so I ca give LR equal to I am takig a variable ame called LR because liear regressio so elastic et elastic et so iside what are the parameters are comig Alpha is the oe parameter ad L1 ratio is aother parameter there are two parameters oe is Alpha ad aother is L1 ratio so I am givig Alpha Alpha is equal to some Alpha I am providig ad L1 ratio L1 ratio equal to L1 ratio I'm providig because these are my parameters I wat to chage these parameters every time I created a ew model okay mid it that I wat to chage these parameters I am creatig a ew model so L1 ratio why this is error is comig because these are the parameters we eed to give you the fuctio also Alpha comma L1 ratio ow this will goe ow elastic et is there ow fit ow develop your model model developmet o which data trai data so trai X comma trai y this is your model is developed so model creatio is happeed ow what we'll do model predictio ow model predictio model predictio will happe o which data X test data X test data model predictio will be happe so that is predicted data predicted data equal to LR dot predict because your model is which ame is there LR so LR dot predict which data you eed to pass Test X so this is model predictio ow be careful guys just uderstad this three steps first trai test plate ext call the model ext fit the model ext model predictio so ext what we will do model evaluatio model evaluatio ow model evaluatio what are your evaluatio techiques you have take rmse this three mea absolute error mai square error R2 Square so model evaluatio will compare o which data which data model evaluatio predictios versus test data predictio forces test data so that we will do evaluatio ow that we will do evaluatio so here rmsc equal to NP dot square root NP dot square root mea squared error mea squared error bracket you eed to compare with your test y with the predicted data simple ow RMS RMS root mea square error guys RMS is othig but what root mea square error I will tell you what is the root mea square error so first error equal to your actual value y actual value mius y predicted value okay suppose actual value is equals 16 is there your model is predicted as 17. how much your error is gettig mius 1 like that so this is error ow we eed to mea square error so first we eed to square this ad the we eed to apply mea is othig but summatio of may observatios first observatio first error error oe secod observatio error 2. third observatio error 3. so you eed to combie all the errors Error 1 Plus error 2 Place error 3 error 3 ad this we are squarig Square 1 square 2 square 3 we are applyig a mea so this is called mai square error the ame itself what mea square error if you apply the root that is called rmse so this is a metric okay I'm ot goig to about much deal much deeper i that because that is ot our iterest right I just wat to give you a quick glace what is rmse it is a root mai square error that is a rmsc ext mea e m a is othig but mea absolute error these are the metrics these are the Matrix mai absolute error so agai same y test sorry test y comma predicted data agai R2 Square R2 is equal to R2 score of test y comma predicted data so this is the full plasma so we are callig model modal predictio modal evaluatio till ow is that clear everyoe foreig we will do that I am ot comig to that way okay we'll do that model register we will do okay we are goig step by step good ow you eed to log these parameters what is the ext step is importat is I wat to track my I wat to track my modal parameters ad model metrics ad model ame so this is called we are registerig we wat to register our models we wat to register our metrics we wat to register our parameters so for that what we will do is we eed to go for here we eed to log that parameters you ca prit also while doig you ca prit also I'll just prit this okay prit prit Mia sorry comma Mae ad prit that R2 score comma R2 score so we are pritig ow ext importat is what log The Matrix log this Matrix parameters parameters ad model o ML flow o ML flow okay so ow ml flow DOT log uder the log we have artifacts is there Matrix is there param scissor okay so we are goig for log param so log param o which ame I wat to log this my ame is Alpha Alpha is my ame I wat to log Alpha agai same ml flow DOT log param what is I what is the param ow L1 ratio L1 ratio is my param that is called L1 ratio so parameters are completed ow ml flow ow Matrix ow there are three metrics are there ml flow ml flow DOT log metric DOT log metric okay what is the metric first oe RMS is my metric ame whatever you give here ame that will be visible guys if you give your your ame that will be visible okay so rmsc ad same thig I wat to just copy here two times but here is Mia [Music] ad here Mae ad the here R2 square that is equal to R2 ow this is doe ow I wat to log what I wat to log my model also ml for ML flow Dot skl so we have already sql is there right skl DOT log model what is that DOT log model what is your model ame your model ame is what LR what your model ame LR so my model ame is called LR comma the ame is called modal ow what is your register model I wat to register my model I wat to register my model so registered model ame is equal to elastic et my model ame is called elasticet oce you created your LR model that will be uder the model it will register we will see that ow how it will happe ow I'm just ruig this okay ow what are the two parameters takig Alpha ad L1 ratio we are callig this trai model okay ow we are callig this so I am givig here suppose 0.3 ad I'm givig here 0.2 ow I'm ruig this ow see rmsc is this Mei is this ow you see successfully model is registered with ame what elastic et ad what is the versio versio is oe these are importat to otice what your model ame is called elastic et what is the versio versio is oe ow wheever you ru i the left side there is a ml rus folder will be created okay i the left side ml rus folder will be created if you click o the ml rus if you click o the ml rus there is a your experimet ID will be there if you otice this is your experimet ID guys okay go to here check your experimet ID where is the experimet IDC so this experimetary five six five three two five six five three to your experimet ID ow here your models is there i the model there is a model m is what elastic et that you give right elastic et that model you give here elastic et what is the versio here oly oe versio oly oe versio is there ow if you click o the versio if you click o this method.aml you will see what is the timestamp what is updated what is the ame what is the Ru ID this is importat what is the Ru ID with this ru ID if you go to your experimets the same ru IDs will be there here see same ru ID ow if you go to the iside ru ID we have five thigs oe is artifacts Matrix params ad tags Matrix meas what you log rmse Mia R2 that Matrix will come to here what is the value 0.51 see 0.51 is your value what is R2 0.23 is your value what is rmse 0.66 your value this is a matrix ad what parets you give Alpha ad L1 ratio 0.3 ad 0.2 so this is the artifacts artifacts is othig but your model that pickle will be available so your model ow you ca had over to cliet bios called Model dot pickle ad to ru this etire setup what is your requiremet.txt I eed ml flow This Cloud pickle pathlib sql typig extesio so everythig will be available here guys okay everythig will be available here so agai I am repeatig so just see here just otice this so this is ot the fial thig we eed to show this i the ml flow UI that is our ultimate goal okay ow see here wheever you created your ml flow workspace they clearly say artifact locatio is cotet ml rus three two five three two so wheever you ru your code it will create a ml rus iside it will create a experimet ID ow iside you are you have ru oly oe time right that's why oe ruide is created suppose I have ru two secod time ow see see the beauty here suppose I give a value is called four argumet value is called five ow same ame that meas I am ruig secod time uderstood the same ame I am ruig secod time that mea ow versio 2 should create right ow I ru this ow euro ew ru ID Now ew versio is created versio two ow you go here you go here just refresh this go to your models elastic et is your ame oly oly oe ame uder oe ame how may versios is created ow two versios versio oe versio two what is your versio ID what is your versio ID is your versio ID ow go iside the experimet ow you ca see seve to be user oe more IDE ad all your metrics will be ow here params everythig will be here so this is how it will works ml flow ow our mai goal is we eed to show we eed to show this o ML flow UI first of all are you uderstad till ow this yeah yes correct exactly two metrics we ca use may metrics Nai okay why we are drop quality we are ot droppig we are droppig ad we are processig here you see here okay that is the overall story right I'm sayig while you are passig you are creatig your model we are ot droppig you are passig your trai X ad trai y why is your quality oly okay ml models packages pytho packages will create such that you eed to pass your iput ad output separately that's why we are droppig okay ow everythig we are loggig ot oly rmsc meae there are so may metrics will be available oce you lear about data sciece course you will get to kow that okay ext ow you uderstad ow what is our goal is ml flow UI ow thik like this ow I wat to go to the ml flow UI so this is your Google collab otebook okay this is your Google colum book this is your ml flow platform this is your ml flow UI whatever you doe ow you eed to trasfer here right to do this to do this we eed to create some tuel what you eed to create a tuel tuel you eed to create ormal Eglish ame create so to coect Google collab to ml flow UI we eed to create a tuel what we eed to create tuel so I will tell you what is the tuel ow so ow I will give all aswers ow at the ed ow okay because it should ot miss the flow ml flow UI to ru to create to create ml flow UI from Google collab otebook Google collab otebook we eed to create a tuel we eed to create a tuel ad that tuel ame is called the tuel ame is grok what is the ame is called grok Remember the Name  grok what is the ame  Grog what is grok grok is your tuel who is created this way the road okay the compay ame the compay ame is grok what the compay will do it will create a tuel from your local collab otebook to your UI that is called tuel ormal Eglish ame it is a road the road compay ame is called grok compay ame is what  grok ow we will pip istall pip istall ad grog first okay I eed to istall that grok ow  grok is istallig ad grock is istallig ow  gruck is istalled ow what we will do is we'll try to create a tuel create a tuel ow create a tuel we will create a tuel so pip istall from pi ad grok import grok okay pi ad grok I thik we eed to istall pi ad grock I thik ot oly utritioal Pie Grove because grok is ot workig owadays will work okay ad grog they are removig egrock actually they are callig that the pi ad Croc so pi ad grok ad grog so ext we eed to create a tuel tuel ad grow I will give a ame called grok tuel I will give you ad grog tuel equal to  grok dot coect it is a UI right wheever you wat to coect a UI we eed to give some address also that address geerally people will give 5000 report okay ad prototype also we eed to give that is http so this is I do't eed to explai because there is a UI UI should be i our server so that's why we are givig 5000 port i the http ow what we will do will prit will prit a trackig URI a trackig URI with the ame of trackig URI I wat to track my  Grog uderscore tuel Dot Public URI ayoe ca access public URL I'm just clickig this okay very simple guys we are tuel this is a compay compay ame is called grok we are coectig with address 5000.\",\n",
       " \"I'm just clickig this whe I clickig this what they are sayig traffic was successfully tuel to the grok aget but aget failed to establish ow we created a tuel successfully but this aget is ot givig permissio to create a UI why this is Aget is ot give permissio because you should ot provide a autheticated ID the aget does't kow the aget aget does't kow does't kow your ID your ID so that's why he is ot givig permissio he is ot givig permissio simple guys first what we are goig we are goig to a compay called grok to make a tuel from which place to which place Google collab Notebook 2 Google collab Notebook 2 your ml flow UI ml flow UI so we created a tuel but the tuel is ot givig permissio because we does't provide our ID ow what we will do we will provide our ID ow so get help with this error ow it will reach to here you just click o the logi just click o the logi ow whe you log i it will ask your email ID ad it will create with homecare.alagoi real gmail.com okay it wheever you log i it will ask your Gmail ID we already have Gmail ID is ope that's why it is goig directly ow go ito the your Autheticatio go to the or autheticatio ow this is your autheticatio ID okay I just pass ito the uh Google collab otebook okay like this I'm goig to edit as HTML I just copy this I'm just pastig i the Google collab otebook ad just paste here so that I ca access from here oly so this is my ID this is my ID so this is my auth ID so autheticatio ID autheticatio toke equal to this is my authority so my give my autheticatio ID ow same thig I will take okay same thig I am takig if you have autheticatio ID you do't eed to go to here guys okay o eed to go to here if you do't have autheticatio ID first ru this the it will redirect to oe place it will redirect to oe place ad the if you go to help it will redirect to aother place the logi it will redirect to your Gmail gmail.com from there you will get autheticatio toke directly copy for every email ID oe autheticatio toke will be available oe autheticatio toke will be available the postma we ca't use Abhishek here that's a differet case i the API testig so this is a creatig a tuels okay ow udershow right if you have autheticatio toke is there do't go directly here directly you ca write like this so I am creatig this here if already a tuel is established I wat to kill the tuel so I wat to do  grog.kill already a tuel is already existed I am killig the tuel okay so this is I ca say if ay tuels are there if ay ope tuels are there close that so for that  grok dot kill ow autheticatio toke ow ad ow said that  grok dot set Auto toke author toke your auth toke what is your author toke authorizatio uderscore to agai I have set my toke my set so I give my ID whe I give my ID I ca create the tuel ow simple step by step uderstad the steps if ay tuels are there kill the tuels cue your autheticatio toke set your toke ad create the tuel ow tuel is created okay ow we'll click o this whe I click o this ow see there is o error it is askig visit site whe it is askig visit site this is we are we are success we're good so for that we eed to ru ml flow UI we eed to ru what ml flow UI we eed to ru so ml flow UI wheever you ru ad the you go to here withi the site whe you visit the site it will create a UI see how beautifully the UI is ow agai I'm repeatig guys oe we provided autheticatio toke we ru this it will cost the visit site oce it is doe you eed to ru your ml flow UI util you work o this this code is still ru oly ow we'll just familiar with ML flow UI what is your experimet ID tell me what is your experimet ID ame what is your workspace ame what your workspace ame guys ml offs uderscore somethig oe right see this is your workspace ml flow ml Ops workspace how may times you model do you ru two times you have ru oe is 16 miutes ago aother is 12 miutes ago what is your model ame oe is first oe versio 16 miutes ago you have ru that is the oe versio oe 12 miutes ago you have ru that is versio two ow if you click o place you have Matrix is there your parameters is there you ca compare those also ow first time whe I ru that is 0.511 ad secod time 0.547 first time whe I ru 0.662 secod time 0.694 this way is othig but model trackig modal performace model moitor okay we'll go step by step agai this is ml flow workspace iside how may times you create a ru your model two times what is your ru ame regressio is your our ru ame what is your Matrix we already logged all these metrics ow I'm just clickig o regressio ow this is your ru ID this is your ru ID ad model is registered here model is registered o 2023 0 4 16. what is the ame of the model elastic et what is the versio is a V1 ow your model is registered this is your model.pickle file this is your amml file ml file will give you what what is the depedecies what is the PIP fuctios ad everythig this is your ml model everythig so if you dowload this if you dowload this you ca had out to your cliet he ca ru ad he ca get the output that's be some simple that is okay ow parameters uder this ru ID what are the values uder this ru ID what are the metrics ad what are the work model everythig that is your models artifacts ad everythig ad they also give your predictio code also you ca directly call this oe ad you ca do this so we'll go step by step agai okay first step go to your workspace uderstad this UI how may times you have ru two times what is your ru ame regressio what is your model ame elastic et go to your models how may what is your model ame elasticet what is your latest versio versio 2 click o this how may times you have ru two times oe is versio oe aother is versio two so it is trackig versio also if you ru oe more thig it is versio three it is versio 3. ow do you feel which versio of model is good do you feel do you feel which versio of model is good support is sayig sir my versio oe model is good versio oe model is good suppose Abhishek is sayig my versio model is good my versio is model is good ow there's a two steps will be there guys oe is stagig ad aother oe is productio okay stagig is othig but what stagig is othig but it is a Alpha versio Alpha versio productio is othig but beta versio that meas stagig is othig but it is o our local systems it is iteral use iteral use that meas we are ot give to the cliet to that those models are i the productio level that cliet ca use okay i outside idustry we have two thigs are there oe stagig will be there aother oe is productio is there I am thikig I am thikig versio oe versio oe is a good model is a good model that ca go ito the productio level is sayig that sir my versio oe model is good I wat to set up ito the productio level so for that what we will use we will go to the versio oe the the stage will be there trasitio to stagig trasitio to productio or you do't wat to use this model go to Archive so versio oe is model is good I wat to use i the productio the I am puttig the productio level ow I'll go to my elastic et I am goig to my models ow my elastic et is my model ame what is my latest versio versio 2 is my latest versio but what is i the productio productio is the versio oe is there i the productio ow you thik versio 2 is i the stagig ow go to i the versio 2 put i the stagig eviromet ow people will thik like that this versio 2 is ow i the stagig level already versio 1 is sedig ito the productio level so cliet ca use the versio oe model but versio 2 is i the iteral use oly still developmet is goig o that is the meaig of stagig level this is a meaig of productio level ad you ca go to the experimets ad you ca get the versio to model also from your workspace this is a versio 2 model this is a ru ID this is a metrics everythig will be there so this is we are loggig we are register the model we are deploy the model we are trackig the model we are model versioig is happeig ad fially i ext few miutes we will iferece the model also we will see so this is the beauty of ml Ops guys s ow I will give pass you ca ask me if ay doubts thak you Abhishek you ca put i the chat because we almost completed this ad oly the iferecig is there I will show the iferece also ow if you wat ppds mL of a third party server provider exactly rajwal mL of you kow the beauty of this oe uh how it is oly three guys are rollig here okay oly three guys i the world oe is gcp oe is AWS oe is azure okay ow what we'll do I am workig with Acceture right so called Acceture or TCS or Ifosys we do't have ay Cloud setup right we do't have ay Cloud setup what we will do we will pay the moey to will pay the moey to either gcp Service as a AWS service or Azure service so they will offer this mlos platform or automl so called like this they will perform like this so ml Ops ow databricks is there that is also you ca use ml office tie up with so may compaies ml flow like that so every ew data we eed to work o the lower eviromet oce we test i the stage exactly exactly that is the correct but we eed to create some Pipelies okay you will ot create automatically you every time you should ot go you should ot create you will create some Pipelies how the pipelies will be there data igestio ad the data pre-processig pre-processig ad data Eda ow Eda is the very biggest star spread i the ideas there are so may drop tasks will be there feature selectio will be there feature egieerig will be there so may thigs will be there ad the we'll deploy a models ad the you log eter everythig yeah yeah that is the GitHub actios is importat ow you you I developed a suppose i my team ivitig five members are there okay five members are there I have worked I have worked o model developmet okay you are workig you are workig o Eda okay some other perso is workig o data igestio we all created dot py files oly dot py it's also dot py file oly this is also dot P Wi-Fi oly ow this all dot pofi ow I there's a GitHub is there ow you will push your code i the GitHub or GitHub or devops whatever it is you will push your record i the GitHub GitHub ad this guy also put your code i the GitHub there's a oe guy is there devops guy there's a oe guy is the devops guy what he will do he will Cosolidated our course Cosolidated our codes ad he will trigger the pipelie so that course ca be updated course ca be updated oce course ca be updated with ew code with a ew code your pipelie tree will trigger your ml flow will be triggered so that is called git actios that is also we will ed i our arratio so ew data ever go directly to the plot o ever produce productio level cliet should use cliet will ask may questios you kow you kow right how may cliet will ask the questios they ever uderstad aythig but we eed to explai to them everythig so ever go directly actual Adroid is what is happeig right so I am workig a compay called make SM okay ow make a si so we are developig some ml models to the vacatio we are developig some ml models ow the makers ad the data from the data they are gettig from PWC PWC that meas PWC is respodig for data they will give the medicie ow make a set equal to the Acceture ow data egieerig guys will do the data igestio ow data sciece will guide to the model developmet ow ml egieerig I will do the mL of both are same you are doig the same task owadays ow these guys always talk with PWC data ow this guy will say exted to the makasa how it is happeig ad everythig like that yeah yeah Rosha you ca cotact with admi we are we are startig that MLS batch so oce cliet everyoe certified share will push the product correct vekat you're absolutely correct our model do Ed automatically yeah we eed to create some Pipelies okay but this you eed to cotact with uh admi okay yeah we'll create a Pipelies so it is ot over those completed data sciece so we ca uh data sese it is good for two data sciece also if you kow the good go to data sese the you ca do that or you ca call to uht we will give a clear guidace o this actually we have oe more step is there guys okay wait for last miute okay we have oe more step is there what is our oe more step we reduce the predictios just copy this okay I'm just stoppig this ow okay ow this is my model this is my model which model versio 2 model I am loadig my model I wat to pass my test text the I will get my outputs these are my outputs if ay ew data will come they'll directly pass here ad they will get the output as simple as that because this is a free versio that's why we are stoppig ad we are ruig ad we are goig ad checkig there's a paid versios will be there actually if you pay that the you ca do automatically this that thig if this is a prepared versio is ot a paid versio that's why we are stoppig here whe you stop your ml flow will goe does UI will goe so that is a simple drawback here because we are usig a free versio right that's why so ow this is a ed to ed ml flow guys I hope you uderstood the everythig flow okay I hope that we have a very good sessio we have very good sessio you uderstad some extet some extet you uderstood how the life cycle how the data sciece life cycle will happe life cycle will happe so I'm expectig that you ca you ca say that i the chat also eed to Deep dive more yeah this is a simple task Workshop is ot like that Workshop is ot like that it is a simple like it is a first task so that i the goig o we ca do more tasks also that is but what we lear what is ml villai ad ext types of ml villai ad we lear data sciece lifecycle we lear ad we have see some good examples also why we eed ml Ops N2 ad ed to ed flow of mL of ad we lear about practical implemetatio practical implemetatio usig ml flow ml flow so we covered may thigs yeah yeah if ay ay course related because I am a traier right I uh that ay course related ay course related okay erollmets ad everythig the admi guy is there at aresh ID so admi guys are very they are Cooperative they will explai each ad everythig for you you ca cotact to directory we always try to give the best teachig ad best Cocepts to you we always yes defiitely Pawa because data sciece people kow oly what you kow oly to create models right yeah tfx everythig you're correct airflow could be flow everythig will be there you're right yes i the cloud that is specific Cloud we use gcp gcp we ca do that AWS or azure databricks we'll do that say subbu what is happeig right uh I ca say AWS Azure ad everythig is like a mobile phoe okay if you kow oe thig you ca kow other easily if you kow gcp o oe ca teach for Azure also you ca easily kow Azure also oly the thigs like a real me phoe ad iPhoe ad Samsug phoe that's all okay yeah ml apps usig tesorflow that's a t f x t f x ad Kobe flow ad ml flow is all MLS yes Rosha you're right yes all sessios are Hads-O oly mL of meas Hads-O that's it so that you eed to cotact with uh yes we'll cover all these thigs yeah batch ad duratio everythig please cotact to admi I hope you have a good sessio so we always here to provide a best teachig facility to you yeah you ca cotact everythig is admi

       "{\"yes yeah it's great thak you so before goig to start I will give you some quick poits ad uh first thig is my voice is clear that is very happy to hear ad this sessio is regardig to machie learig operatios that is ml Ops so this sessio is both Theory ad practicals okay Theory ad practical practically about ed to ed flow ed to ed flow of mlos mlos so that is the first thig it is a both icludes Theory as well as practicals ad this sessio is about two hours I'm expectig for two hours it might be good for 2.5 hours also because this is a very very importat topic we eed to coect with cloud ad we eed to Showcase that how it is works ad I will take all the questio ad aswers I will give some pass i Middle as well as at the ed so all q ad a sessio you ca take at  most probably you ca ote your questios I will give each ad every oe aswers okay ad first of all I eed oe cofirmatio how may of you kow about data sciece data sciece ad machie learig three parts oe preset four five yeah it's a good umber of people or kows that's very appreciate that but this sessio is etered from scratch level okay so I will go with scratch from do to uderstad high level flow that meas both Techical ad o-techical people ca uderstad I ca say that so this sessio is from scratch some scratch those who do't kow about machie learig do't kow about machie learig also they ca Now uderstad at least what is machie learig those who already kow about machie learig they kow about what is ml operatios how it is workig exactly so that is our ed goal so there are two face of cadidates I'm seeig here oe kows ML ad oe do't kow about ml but do't worry I will give from scratch level uderstadig you ca uderstad easily i the both levels so comig to the myself I am omkar alagoi um curretly workig as a seior data scietist seior data scietist seior data scietist with Acceture so I have total seve plus years experiece i ID traiigs i it ad traiigs ad this seve plus years experiece completely relevat ad data sciece ad mL of ad some part of data Egieerig also that is the cloud operatios everythig ad I have completed my PG diploma PG diploma i data sciece from IIT tirupati IIT tirupati as well as I have a certified gcp ml egieerig ml egieerig ad I have a certified i the Staford Uiversity Staford Uiversity deep learig course so I ca say it is a deep learig code that is a cs-232 course ID is so that's all myself so we will quickly go to the our sessio ow yeah it's okay eve though if you are a Java studet if you are ot a IT backgroud studet this will uderstad that is ot a issue Pawa yeah this I will go from very scratch level I'm just sharig my scree here ad the today our topics to be covered is what is machie learig because what is machie learig we are usig ad what is the types of machie learig data sciece of life cycle ad after that what is mL of why we use mL of mL of ed-to-ed workflow ad fially we will Implemet practical implemetatio of ml Ops usig ml flow okay why we are goig for machie learig types of machie learig data Scieces here there are all type of cadidates will be available some people kow about data sciece some people kow do't kow about that assigs so that's why bear with us those who are already kow about machie learig okay so let's start the sessio so first oe what is machie learig why it is importat so i my case I ca I ca say easily so here I'm just goig to the show preseter View ad just ask Barts yeah data sciece data sciece ad measure or machie learig machie learig is a part of a data sciece okay machie learig deep learig NLP is a part of data sciece ml is a moder astrology moder astrology I ca proudly say this moder astrology what you will do i astrology i astrology i astrology you will predict the future you will predict the future but without ay evidece without ay evidece but data sciece ad machie learig will predict the future DS or ml i the shortcut data sese is the DS machie learig is ml will predict the future predict the future with evidece with the solid evidece with solid evidece I ca say solid evidece ad this evidece comes from some mathematical algorithms this evideces comes from mathematics mathematics algorithms so those those mathematical all algorithms mathematical algorithms we are sayig machie learig algorithm simple we are sayig ml algorithms very simple so machie learig is geerally it is the predict somethig by usig mathematics that's all ad that mathematics based o that we will develop so may ml algorithms like suppose I will give oe example okay provide me your compay employees attritio or the previous history suppose you have a compay called some Google compay is there take the example ow Google give me a data they're the previous employees history those who are every year those who are leavig the compay if you give me the data I will aalyze the patters I will aalyze the patters ad I will say i the ext couple of the years i the ext years how may people how may employees will stick with your compay how may employees stick with your compay stick with your compay we ca say that suppose you are a sales you are a dmod ower you are a dmart ower you wat to idetify your loyal customers loyal customers give me give me employees sorry give me customers customers trasactio data customer trasactio data I ca say who are your loyal customers who are your loyal customers I ca say that suppose you are a bak maager suppose you are a bak maager you wat to idetify whether a perso ca pay the loa or do't pay the loa you ca pay the loa or do't pay the loa do't pay the loa give me give me your M customers data previous data I ca say easily you ca pay the loa or do't pay the loa this is all our use cases these all our use cases that you ca predict the compay future by usig called machie learig what machie learig will geerally do it will aalyze the data aalyze the data ad patters it idetifies some patters Idetify some patters i the data patters i the data usig mathematics usig math so I will give a example everyoe kows a movie called super 30 right supercetig that's the famous Aad Kumar biography is a IIT traier i that there is a scee called Truth Rosha wet to a hotel okay he will say to the hotel guy your hotel will ot ru i ext two years will ot ru i ext two years he will say that if you remember that ad he will say your hotel will ot rai ext two years that hotel will shock how it is happe the come up with some calculatios okay so mathematics ad if the the hotel guy will believe so that is the power of mathematics if you people if you say the statemets people will ot people will ot covice coveyace with statemets people will covice with umbers should talk ot statemets that is the beauty of data ad Aalysis people will covice with them if I say Usai Bolt will 100 meters ru he ca do i the eight secods if I say that you will ot believe but if I show the statistics of Usai Bolt you ca defiitely believe so that is the power of mathematics ad those we are implemetig the machie learig algorithm but how this will happe how this will happe how this will happe how this will happe how the patters are happeig how the patters are happeig everythig how they are thikig ow everyoe talkig about AI ml deep learig they're talkig about that how these patters are happeig I will give oe example i our families we have a kids is there right small kids you wat to trai your kid trai your kid with some iformatio some iformatio trai your kid with some iformatio what is the iformatio example oe okay example oe you are watchig a TV you are watchig a TV okay ow you say you say to your kid your kid this is a TV this is your TV ow because the kid is a huma beig huma he ca uderstad he ca uderstad what you say ad he will uderstad some patters you will uderstad some patters what is the patters first patter it is a rectagular box it is a rectagular box secod patter some color colors are there obviously i the TV some show is ruig colors will be there right some colors are there ad third poit some cartoo people also there you'll uderstad the cartoos you do't kow about Shahrukh Kha you do't kow what Salma Kha is comig i the TV right he will simply uderstad the cartoos so these patters he ca uderstad that meas he uderstads the patters he's ot a system his erve system is uderstadig the patters that is we are talkig about euros owadays i the Deep learig ow secod example ow secod example you wet to the theater you wet to the theater or Mall to watch a movie to watch a movie ow ask a questio to your kid ow ask a questio to your kid ask a questio your kid what is this what is this ow based o his patters what is his patters his rectagular box theater screeigs rectagular box yes some colors are goig yes some cartoos are goig yes the what is you'll say aswer he will say mama this is a TV ow you will say o it is wrog it is wrog it is ot a TV it is a theater the he will uderstad he will add the fourth patter okay it's a big scree some big rectagular scree is there big rectagular scree is there so that he will uderstad okay if it is a small rectagular box is there it is a TV if it is a big rectagular box is there it is a theater ow ask the third example ow watch movie i laptop watch movie i laptop ad ask the questio what is this ow he already kow about the small thig is Stevia ad big thig is rectagular that is a theater he will either because he is a huma beig he ca uderstad the patter he will either say he either say TV or say theater because he kows he is a huma beig the same thig how you are traied the iformatio how you are traied the iformatio how this guy is uderstadig the patters if that iformatio you are testig with ew data textig with ew data ow you are uderstadig whether he ca say right aswer or wrog aswer if it is say right you are happy your model is good if it is wrog agai you are tradig with ew data so that's where that's where the machie learig will applicable actually so that's what is patters how our huma beig i midset we are discussig about patters i the same way the mathematics also will discuss the patters the mathematics will geerate the patters ow if you see here we are sedig a traied data we are creatig some ml algorithm the model is created ow i the same way you are providig you are a TV you are providig a theater ow you are askig a questio what is this he might be predicted somethig so that predictio you will do evaluate whether he say good okay if you say wrog agai you eed to trai with the dose data so that way machie learig all Gardes will works I hope those who are do't kow about machie learig ow we ca some extet he ca kow about the what is machie learig right ca I say yes or o i the chart you ca give me replay i the chat also I ca pass oe miute yeah thak you so ext ext we have some types of learigs will be happeed because there are so much data is there right ad the data is a huge data will be there so that's why what they are doig machie learig people they are dividig some types i that oe type is called supervisor learig supervisor learig ad aother type is called usupervised learig oe more type is called reiforcemet learig it is very easy guys supervisor learig meas suppose you have a use cases there i the use case you have some iput data is there ad output data is there so what is iput data ad what is output data ow comig to this Bak data suppose suppose you go here so this is a bak data some loa ID is there some geder is there educatio is there self-employed applicat icome loa amout loa amout term is there ad loa status so what is the objective of this data you eed to idetify the customer whether we ca grat a loa him or ot that is objective the objective is so for this loa IDK 1002 what is the status yes you are grated a loa you are ot grated a loa okay so these kid of data if you see that meas this loa ID geder educatio employed these are we ca say iput colums what we ca say iput colums ad what you are seeig loa status we ca say this is output colum because you wat to predict somethig so tomorrow I am goig with my ID I am a male cadidate I am a graduate I am ot a self-employed ad the my applicat icome is there so whether he ca provide the loa or ot that meas i the data you have some iput data will be there ad output that I will be there if you see that kid of thig we ca say this is a supervisor learig we ca say so I have see some participats raise their hads but I will pass i Middle you ca ask your questio i the chat at the time I will defiitely aswer okay ow ext uder the shoe I kow we got what is supervised learig here so I'll just give a example here Super Wise to the learig supervised learig meas we have some iput data will be there iput data will be there ad correspodig we have output database also will be available output data but agai i the iput data ad output you have a supervised learig i that supervisor learig agai we have oe more techique is called classificatio classificatio techique ad secod oe is we ca say regressio techique classificatio regressio what is the geeral Eglish meaig of classificatio guys what the geeral meaig of Eglish class meaig classificatio you are classified somethig classified somethig okay you are you are classificatio somethig like s or o some zoes like support covet Joes owadays Kobe Joes what is that gree zoe gree zoe orage Zoe Red Zoe some classificatio some parts are fail pass or fail these are the classificatio so here i the data here loa status is y is there ad loa status is o is there s is there o is there it is a classificatio so first questio is do we have output data yes do we have output data if thus output data is a categorical or ot ow ext questio is if that output data output data is i the form of categorical categorical some Eglish ames categorical the it is called classificatio techique simple so ow I will a questio this is a supervisor learig or ot this data is a supervised learig or ot yes it is a supervised learig how ca we are sayig it has iput data is there ad it has output data also there so it is a supervised learig ext questio it is a classificatio problem or regressio problem ow check the output if output is a categorical data of umerical data output is a categorical data so it is a classificatio problem ow oe more example I will take ow here my objective is predict the total umber of sales based o the advertisemet cost o differet medium I have a ower of some so so I am a ower of D Mart okay I wat to icrease my sales so what I decided I wat to sped some moey o some advertisemet advertisig so I sped some moey o TV ad ewspaper ad social media I wat to predict my sales if I sped this much what is my sales 2000 if I sped this much what is my sales it is a 1950 so first of all do you idetify the iput here what is your iput colums here TV ewspaper social media what is your output colum sales ow tell me it is a supervised learig or ot yes it is a supervised learig but if this your output is a umerical data or categorical data it is a umerical data ow output is output is a umerical data umerical data so if it is a umerical data the that model we called regressio model what is the model called regressio model so that is the supervised learig that is the first oe ad ext oe if you see here ext oe is called usupervised learig usupervised learig so usupervised learig is very simple guys supervised learig we are seeig some output data is there i the usupervised learig we do't have output data very simple we do't have output data what is the example for that ow see here the example for this this is called the objective is segmet or group the customers based o the aual icome ad spedig source ow you are a d Mart ower ow you have some customer IDC is there their age is there their geder is there ad the aual icome also there ad the spedig scores every moth the customers are comig to your market ad they are spedig somethig moey ad you are givig some spedig score based o the spedig score you wat to idetify whether they are a rich customers or poor customers they are importat customers are ot importat customers you wat to group them so here there is o output data your our use case is I wat to segmet the people I wat to divide the people how may people are my rich customers how may people are my poor customers I wat to divide those groups so that's why it is called it is a usupervised learig so that is the thig ad what you are seeig is called some algorithms like I said machie learig is developed by mathematics so that mathematics we are callig ml algorithms so agai machie learig is to divide it to three parts supervised ad usupervised so uder supervise you have some classificatio problem is there ad you have regressio problem is safe so classificatio meas you have a output data that is the step oe ad ext that output data is categorical the go for these may algorithms decisio trees Navi bias svm do't worry about these algorithms okay but just uderstad the high level View uderstad the high level view first of all machie learig is mathematics simple I will give you a fuy example I'll see you at this you have a data is there whe X is equal to 1 Y is equal to oe X is equal to Y is equal to 4 X is equal 3 Y is equal to 9 x equal to 4 Y is equal to 16 whe I say x is equal to 20 what Y is equal to tell me what is the Y is equal to put i you are aswerig the chart I just wat to see your yeah very good 400. how did you say this 400 how did you say this 400 because i your mid you created some mathematics equatio that is called Y is equal to x square this is ml algorithm guys this is a simple ml algorithm based o the previous data based o the previous data you predicted oe ml algorithm the you are sedig this x is equal to 20 to this algorithm it is givig Y is equal to 400 simple that's it ow thik about imagie as a big data is there for the Big Data you eed some calculus ad algebra mathematics we will develop some mathematical equatio like this so those mathematical algorithms we have give some ames that's all but mathematics is very simple mathematics that we are usig that is algebra algebra ad calculus all geographical so oly simple mathematics we are ot doig ay itegratio or differetiatio that we are ot usig here simple algebra ad calculus we will develop some ml models I hope people should uderstad ow what is exactly ml model meas this is your history data you created a ml model ow so ow people already created some more ml models by usig some mathematics we are usig that ow these are the some usupervised learig algorithms ad supervised learig algorithms do't worry about algorithms agai I am sayig that algorithms is othig but some mathematics simple algorithms is othig but a mathematics ow comig to the reiforcemet learig reiformig is geerally aget agets should respod with our actios like iPhoe Siri okay iPhoe series is a hey Siri what is the time ow if you say us it will give us some time right so that is a reiforcemet learig so ow robotic self-drivig cars Alexa these are the reiforcemet learig Earth Gardes so that's why we call so so I called AI owadays yeah ow if you see i 2019 I thik i 2019 our ISRO uh do for magala 2. okay that is for the moo they actually should lad at some place but due to the evirometal coditio it is ladig some other place that's why it is failed here whe it is ladig it is ot able to Ladig successfully because the evirometal coditios is ot able to respod that aget so they implemeted the AI coditio i the ISRO eviromet but obviously the moo coditios is differet there's a rocket sciece it's ot a easy task so that's why we got some failure but is 95 success that is so like that way the reiforcemet learig owadays the so much moey they are spedig o this reiforcemet learig so this is about the machie learig ad the types guys so I will give oe pass here okay I will give oe pass ad all the cluster algorithms are usupervised algorithms yes you are correct all cluster algorithms are called usupervised learig clusterig othig but groupig or segmetatio your characterizatio if you have ay doubts you ca ask me I will give oe miute we do't kow cluster what is oe me we do't kow cluster how to pursue this course yeah this is a data sciece course that will be talk about maagemet okay yeah yes that is aother city that is our mai evet we'll talk about this all these thigs but at least you ca idetify the high level view right what is machie learig what is data sciece everythig yeah the you ca easily lear about cluster algorithms that is that you ca say ext what is the reiforcemet Ledig yeah course cotet I will that admi will take care of okay that is ot our Workshop thig okay ow okay we'll go to the ext thig that admi will take that first you uderstad the cocept ed to ed flow agai at the ed we will discuss about your doubts okay but i the middle I wat to kow the specific questios that is related to your Cocepts ow some people are algorithm reiforcemet learig algorithm they are askig so reiforce rederig algorithms is completely a algorithms okay that is you ca kow huggig phase Trasformers there's a example that is we ca say huggig phase Trasformers or robotics or Trasformers are there there is a call huggig face Trasformers okay huggig face huggig face or you ca say YOLO there's a YOLO algorithm is there you look oly oce okay you look oly oce you ca test type YOLO you will idetify image objects for self-drivig cars or movig objects they will idetify like this there are some algorithms so ext this is a very very importat guys what is a data sciece life cycle what is a data sese life cycle so of course I told you agai I leared mathematics Islad everythig I wat to implemet the programmig laguage I eed required is pytho okay those who are learig about pytho it is a very good course agai I am sayig that why this is pytho is a tool pytho is a tool pytho is a tool but data sciece is a subject it is a subject okay cyber security cyber security is a subject okay iot is a subject I what is a subject like that ad cloud computig cloud computig is a subject okay cloud computig subject those who are learig the tools my best advice is lear ay oe of the subjects so that you ca master that subject ad there's a so much lifespa i the IIT carrier okay pytho is a tool those who are learig pytho the best choice is data sciece that is ed to ed you ca kow that so ext so data sciece life cycle guys this is the data so ay data sciece lifecycle ot all ay data sciece lifecycle guys suppose you I am a you are a data scietist I am a customer I am some HDFC Bak okay I'm HDFC Bak customer I wat to kow that my customer home loa capacity so first ad most importat is what you eed to uderstad about busiess problem okay first of all what is your problem is the HDFC bak is comig to you ad they will have some help for you the first what is that you eed to uderstad about busiess problem what is your problem oce you uderstad the problem oce you uderstad the problem you eed to collect the data the HDFC bak will provide data to you hfc bak will provide the data to you ext this data might be a structured data or ustructured data data might be a structured data or ustructured data so this data might be a structured way or ustructured way okay ow what you will do you will make a data preparatio you make the data ito structured way or you are puttig ito some database ad ready to use some database you will make ito some database you are load all this data to the i this database ad the data is ready oce data is ready this is the heart of data sciece guys we call Eda exploratory data aalysis exploratory data aalysis what you will do i the data aalysis you will uderstad some isights uderstad some isight what is the iside what is the mea value what is the media value what is the mode what is the variace how it is goig the all statistical Cocepts what is the populatio how the sample is workig ad what is the hypothesis this is all a statistical Cocepts if you remember your childhood days we kow our statistics right so based o the statistics you eed to idetify based o statistics we eed to idetify Idetify some patters Idetify some patters we eed to idetify that so that's why EDI is a very very importat ad the oce EDI is doe we will develop our ml models so called mathematics models ml models you you said sir I created a model okay you said home cursor I created a model but how ca I kow your model is good or ot how ca you kow your Y is equal to x square is a good correct model or ot you developed a y is equal to x square ad you said Assad this is my model verify this how ca I verify by usig model evaluatio whether your model is correct or wrog I eed to do the modal evaluatio the fially your model is ready ad I eed to deploy your model deploymets what this HDFC bak I should use right you created your model here but HDFC bak I should use that is a model deploymet so this is a data sciece lifecycle guys you eed to uderstad the busiess problem data collectio data preparatio the step by step o eed to buy heart also this is this is commo sese I eed to uderstad the problem ext I eed to thik about solutio for to thik about solutio I eed some resources here resources is the data sciece I have data is there I eed to prepare the data i the orgaized way I data is prepared I eed to do some statistical aalysis because my duty is that data sciece duty is oly to uderstad the patters ow I eed to create a model my model is doe ow I wat to verify this model is good or ot that's the evaluatio the I eed to deploy the model because HDFC bak I should use ow data sciece is completed with this ow you created a model ow you created a model thik like this you created created a model I will take Y is equal to x square oly because that you created from your mid just ow okay I'm just kiddig but why is equal to sphere your model you created that model Y is called x square ow HDFC Bak should use that model HDFC Bak should use that model okay this Y is equal to x square you created a model by usig pytho code by usig pytho code is created by usig pytho code ow pytho code you ru i your local pytho code you ru i your local ow how ca HDFC guy use that how ca HDFC I use your model that is the questio umber oe questio umber oe how ca a cliet we ca call cliet use your model so this we are i IT idustry the term called productio okay what would be the term is called productio how ca a cliet use your model i the productio level how ca a cliet use your model i the productio level ad secod questio the cliet is sayig cliet is sayig that sayig that every moth every moth I will geerate geerate a ew data ew data how ca your model respod how ca your model respod o the ew data ad I should write my questio first you created Y is equal to x square ow how ca you had over to the cliet the productio level ext cliet is sayig that every moth I will geerate a ew data how ca your model is respod ow ext third questio is how ca you moitor you ca say moitor or track your model performace modal performace tell me these three questios that's it I'm good so this is your local everythig is your local but how ca you aswer this all questios so that's where we comig mlogs machie learig operatios ow see here after model developmet after model developmet we eed to ask some questios ourselves first questio is how ca we had over a developed model to cliet which meas how ca we deploy our model o productio level that is the first questio valid questio right this is a very valid questio because your model is developed i a local system i my computer I developed but how ca I had over to the cliet it's a valid questio ow how ca we trai our model agai o the fresh data ow oe like customers are comig i this moth April ad two lakh customers are comig i the Jue ow your model you your pytho code should be geeralized code right that code should trai o the ew data so that is the ext questio how ca we trai our model o fresh data i future o productio level ow third questio how ca we moitor or track our model performace ow this moth April moth oe lakh customers are there I created a model Y is equal to x square is my model my model performace is good I am gettig accuracy is equal 90 percet ow after Jue 2 lakhs customers are comig ow if your model is traiig o the fresh data Maybe your model is performace will drop 70 percet will come how ca you moitor or track the model performace so these are the all valid questios i the Cloud eviromet whe we are trasferrig ito the cliet productio level so there oe more thig is called how ca we maitai the ed-to-ed flow from data igestio to predictio like I told you right data is there ijectio ad you eed to do predictio so from here to Here There Is the Ed to Ed flow is there how ca you maitai this ed-to-ed flow for cliet so where to aswer all about questios our best practice is ml Ops ow see the sceario i the two ways guys oe is developig a model is oe way ad productio as the model is aother way productio level okay developed a model is a data sciece people will do so to do the Productios ml egieerig I will do ml egieerig very simple ml egieerig so I will say I will tell you a beautiful thig ow i the AI world of AI rules i the world of Errors there are three kigs are there first oe is the data egieer guy what data egieer guy will do cliet will come HDFC bak will put some data ito somewhere okay ow the data egieer respod is you eed to igest the data to make use of the data sciece okay that is the data egieer guy so I'm a data egieer my respose is what HDFC bak is givig a data to me I wats to put the data ito i the Some Cloud eviromet some database or SQL Microsoft SQL Server so that data sciece guy ca use the data that is a data egieer guy so this is a base level oe ow data is ready i the cloud data is ready i the database data is ready i the database okay the data sciece will come so what this value guy do you will uderstad the patters ad you will created a ml models it will create a ml models these are data sciece guy o third there is a ml egieer what this guy's respose is he will make use of this ml model to the cliet i the productio level cliets should use productio level so these are all importat people i the world of AI without these guys data egieer data scietist ad we ca say ml egieer so these three guys are very very importat so some maybe the model developmet does't kow about this guy okay the model developmet does't kow about this guy this guy kows model developmet this guy kow how to make ito productio okay but as a good idea guy we eed to kow about how the data sciece algorithms will work ad how the ml egieer should work ow yeah I hope you uderstood right the rules how the roles are distiguished data egieer will igest the data data scietists will do develop the model ml egieer will do productioize the model so this is the rules of i the three people so you ca say ml Ops is a level three level three so I will just show you here for you make you easy I will just write here step oe igest the data step two develop ml models step 3 make use the ml models i the productio eviromet the productio eviromet so this guy is a data egieer guy this guy is a data sciece guy ad this guy is a ml egieer guy MLG so where our ml Ops will come to here everyoe else will come to here so data egieer guys Place data sciece guys will closely work each other closely work each other ow data sciece guys plus ml egieerig guys will closely work to each other closely work each other but they were igestig a data idustry data is a very hectic task okay there are so may people will requiremet here much people eeded here much people eeded here i the same way MLG Egieerig also much people required here because puttig i the productio level is ot a easy task okay so that's why I always remember data sciece ad MLG is the part this both combiatio if you kow about data sese ad MLG the you will lead the idustry you ca lead IIT easily data sciece ad MLD o I kow I hope you have some broad picture ow but I just wat to repeat agai I just wat repeat agai so we have started with our machie learig what is about machie learig ad we kow about types of machie learig ad we kow about data sese life cycle ad after model developmet what is the questios you eed to ask yourself ad the for to all these questios to aswer we go for MLS okay ow good high up till ow you uderstad right everythig the high level flow ca I expect yes yeah to uderstood the high level flow yeah the questios I will take I will aswer all the questios do't worry guys because this sessio is for you oly okay this sectio is especially we are set up for you oly to clear all your high level doubts clarificatios we'll take olie offlie also both yeah we'll talk that at the ed okay ow see ml Ops is the full form is called machie learig operatios that is clear what is mL of score fuctio is machie learig is focused o machie learig models through the productio that oly I am tellig right machie learig models to the productio ad the you eed to maitai ad you eed to moitor very simple guys you eed to put that i the productio ad moitor so mL of is a collaborative fuctio of a data scietist guys ad devops guys it's a combiatio thak God I am workig some mL of project so eve though I'm a data scietist so that I kow about ed to ed flow so I very much thak to God because I have your opportuity to work with ML Ops also because I do't wat stick as a guy with oly I kow models I kow the iterest I wat to kow about ed to ed flow you should be ethusiasm like that so that's why we are here to teach you ow why we eed mlos ow you already have a aswer why you eed MLS because machie learig life cycle is a very complex life cycle you eed to igest the data you eed to apply Eda you eed to do feature egieerig you eed to do the model traiig you eed to about model performace you eed to the predictios you eed to deploymet moitorig ad you eed to do the automated model traiig that is there's so may life cycles are there but these life cycles are trust me guys you ca ejoy this you ca ejoy literally if you kow about this data sciece ad ml Ops you will ejoy the life you ca you oly do the so much work because these all are r d this is all our r d it is ot like a daily routie toss it's ot agai like a rotat us it is like a complete R ad a research ad developmet we are i that so you kow about why we eed mlos ow this where is a very very importat thig guys mL of ed-to-ed workflow first two step is what ml developmet ext ml developmet you eed to create a traiig operatios what is the traiig operatios I will tell you so i ml developmet after ml developmet that meas I ca say ml developmet here step oe ml developmet is there what is ml developmet you will do you will do data igestio you will do okay data igestio you do you will do data preparatio you will do ow you should't you should say the steps ow okay you do data preparatio you will do Eda ad you will do model buildig model buildig ad you will do evaluatio this is all your steps you do data igestio data preparatio Ada model buildig evaluatio we will do that's clear this everythig you will make oe setup guys you will make create a DOT py file dot py file ad some cofig file some cofig file you will create some dot py file some cofig file what is cofig file I hope I ca show you that give me oe miute give me oe miute guys I ca show you the some cofig file so this is a cofig file you see this is the cofig file I have created what is the Q a maker Commuity Services what is the storage Services what is auto complete Services I'm creatig some ames so that I ca use my pytho code okay do't do't worry about Do't Paic about that okay I just wat to show you that what is the cofig files okay what is your ID ad how ca you use that what is your suppose this what is your cotaier ame what is that's my ame is ladig what is your uh storage accout ame these all are some cofig files we are creatig so oce you created your ml everythig you will create some dot py files some cofig file so that is the step oe you eed to do that is othig but your traiig operatios are ready why traiig operatios are ready the cliet is already said cliet is already said every moth he will get you will get a ew data you will get a ew data how ca you trai that you eed to create a automated pipelie right you could eed to create a automated pipelie that pipelie should do what data igestio should do the compoet oe compoet two compoet 3 compoet 4 compoet five these five compoets you eed to create a pipelie so that you ca cotiuously you ca cotiuously cotiuously trai the model trai the model o ew data so this is we ca say CET cotiuous traiig so that's why we eed to create this dot previous cofig files so you create you writte data igestio oe fuctio call data preparatio is aother fuctio call Eda is aother fuctio call model buildig is aother fuctio called evaluatio is aother fuctio call ow total five fuctio calls are called Phi compoets five compoets you created a pipelie you created a pipelie ad that pipelie what it will do every time a ew data will come it will do the same task it will do the same task data igestio data preparatio Ed every time it will do so this is the traiig operatios the code ad cofig we will do what it will do cotiuous traiig it will do after traiig operatios what it will happe cotiuous traiig by usig called traiig pipelie so oe traiig is doe you eed to deploy your model by usig call with register a model ad the we will do the oe the model deploy what is the usig you eed to serve right you eed to predictio whether I ca give the loa or ot whe I we ca I ca uh I ca group the customers or ot Productios by usig a servig package ad fially you eed to moitor that by usig all servig logs so these are the steps very simple you kow what is the first step model developmet ad secod step this is the hard math this is the heart of machie learig cotiuous traiig because ew data is comig I wat to do the cotiuous traiig after traiig is happeed I eed to do the model deploymet after deploymet is happeig I eed to do the serve the I eed to do the moitor I eed to do the moitor I'll give oe example here I'll give oe example here you will uderstad with that example ow suppose you wat to sed you wat to sed a courier a courier to your fried okay Courier or package career or package to your fried you lives i Hyderabad who lives i Hyderabad ad your fried lives i Delhi your fried your fried lives i lives i Delhi so uderstad this example is very very importat guys what you will do step oe what you will do tell me what you will do you will go to The Courier Service you will go to the Courier Service Courier Service ad register ad register a your ame register your ame ad Courier you will register this the step two so after register what you will do you will keep you will keep your package your package i The Courier office Courier office ad step three they will give they will give oe trackig ID they will give oe track ID trackig ID so that you ca track you ca track you ca track ow step four thik like that this you wat to sed you wat to sed aother package aother package i ext moth i ext moth so what will happe this is this moth is package umber oe ad ext moth is package umber two ad ext moth is package umber three some distiguish package umber oe packet umber two package umber three some distiguish will be there ow step five step five your fried should use ed user your fried use use that package fried use that package so these are these life cycle Ma these are the etire life cycle about the package thig ow this we will opt our ml Ops okay ready with dust ow importat steps eed to cosider mL of software model developmet your Courier you are goig to The Courier office ad you are register your package that meas you developed a model you wat to register your model that is called Model registry you register your package the you are keepig your package i The Courier office I register my model ext step is I wat to deploy my model deploymet is the ext step ow you said I wat to repeat this task that is the package umber oe package umber two package umber three ow o the ew data is a model created that is model umber oe i the ext moth it's the model umber two ad ext moth is the model umber three that is called modal versioig ad you wat to track your model that is the performace modal versioig is othig but model 1.0 Model 2.0 ad fially you wat to ed user what is your use case fially so this is a complete mL of steps guys model registry model deploymet model trackig model versioig model iferece so this is the complete mL of theory I hope you uderstood that mL of Siri okay model registry model deploymet model trackig model versioig I will tell you how ca we register the model that is the Practical we will see ow what happeed to shamai i oe miute guys yeah sorry guys yeah thak you ah ow you ad I hope you uderstood about ml Ops ad everythig ow what is the Practical sessio okay let's go to the Practical sessio ow but agai with that I'm repeatig agai what we have doe I'll just go to the my our slides previous slides the steps I eed to do machie learig cocept types of machie learig data sciece life cycle what is mL of why we use mL of ad mL of Cetral ad flow we have doe this ow with this I hope you uderstood about machie learig those who already kow they ca uderstad that I kow very well okay but there are two two types of guys right those who already do't kow about data sciece machie learig I hope you already kow about high level View ad those who already kow about motio learig you kow about how ml Ops is workig that is ow with this we will go for practical implemetatio so for this practical implemetatio I just wat to use here Google collab otebook Google collab otebook Okay Google collab otebook we wat to use that is why we use Google collab otebook why we use Google collab otebook so Google corrupt otebook is a free service pre-service is offerig the Google otebook Jupiter otebook kid of it is there are may two thigs guys oe is if it is a huge big data will be available if it is a huge big data will be available ow Google collab otebook is offerig from 25 GB data 25 GB data so that there is a huge data also you ca process also also it ca give oe GPU access ad TPU access oe GPU access ad TPU access ad secod oe is secod oe is ml Ops geerally is related to the cloud eviromet okay Geeral it is a cloud aime you wat to register a model right you wat to deploy a model that we will use the cloud so the cloud packages istallig Cloud packages istallig Cloud packages istallatio is tricky is tricky whe you i your local otebooks i your local Jupiter otebook so this is easy this is easy easy i Google collab otebook I like this actually because geerally we usually work o the cloud packages so whe we istall i the local Red it is ot at all istalled properly okay we eed to create a virtual eviromet s ad all this thig we eed to see so that's why it is easy i the Google collab otebook so we'll ope a Google collab otebook ow go to here just type Google collab just type Google collab ad the it is a ow it's a Google there's a ew otebook optio will be there click o the ew otebook click o the ew otebook ow here i the top you see right Utitled 3 13 so I just wat right here mL of workflow mL of workflow that is I'm give a ame here i the top okay reame The Notebook so to work o the Google collab otebook guys you eed to coect here the optio there is a coect is there you eed to iteret you eed to coect this that is the coectio it is a coectig so we'll take some i time because go to iteret issues or because of Iteret fast it will go to that iitializatio ad coect that ow secod step is you eed to coect ow it will give some Ram how much RAM it is 12.27 poit GB that is there ow I told you right we have oe GPU ad oe TPU is there go to rutime ow you have a chage rutime type ad there is a GPU is there ad TPU is there so the GPU is there ad TPU is there so if it is a big data you ca use that if it is ot big data do't use that that is ot a issue ad your file is there ad code optio is there text optio is there the beauty of Google collab otebook is it is ca work as a text Word documet you ca write some mathematics you ca write some images ad you ca do the code also that is the beauty of this okay so GPU ad TPU actually wheever you wat to use that right wheever the big data is at to speed up the process to speed up the process we have GPU ad we have TPU is there okay GPU ad TPU like suppose you have a big data is there you have a big data is there wheever you have a big data you eed to process very fast right wheever you wat to very fast you wat to process that we have local we have what CPU will be available locally we have CPU will be available well like four CPUs or three CPC level but GPU is a graphical Processig Uit geerally will speed up your process speed of your process to load suppose thik like that your data set your data set has oe 10 lakh observatio or 1 millio observatios 1 millio observatios to load 1 millio observatios how much time it will take i local how much time it will take local how much time will take i Google collab otebook that is the thig i collab otebook we have a GPU access ad we have a TPU access so that it we ca read very fast it ca read very fast it will be very slow so I ca say CPU is the lowest table GPU is highest level ad TPU is the very fast TPU is a very fast okay so if you wat the CPU this is the key iside GPU I ca use our ame TP is othig but tesor tesor processig uit GP is othig but graphical graphical processig uit ad uiverse if you write what is CPU cetral processig uit Cetral processig uit okay ow we are goig to here agai ow I wat to do my ml Ops here I just wat right here ml offs okay so my my I just write the otes also that is a beauty I like this Jupiter otebooks because you ca write the uh story also ot oly story like I ca do the image also okay I'm goig to here suppose MLS so I'm just takig oe image okay I just wat to show you this image which image I wat to take okay this image I will take ow go to the ispect ad there's a image okay the image is there right you are seeig that image go to the edit as HTML just copy this ad come to here go to the text ad Page this see image is comig ow that's the beauty you ca do the mathematics also like this you ca create the mathematics also okay ow step oe step oe step oe is ay ay ay pack ay code if you wat right you eed to istall a required packages istall required packages istall a required packages ow what is the packages we will use is we will use we wat to istall some packages so I will just display the packages ames here so here we will use a umpy package ad padas package ad sql package ad ml flow package okay umpy package used for what is a umerical pytho umerical pytho it is used for mathematics used for mathematics ad padas package user for data frame ad data aalysis sql package is used for machie learig algorithms machie learig algorithms ow ml flow is the ml flow is our ml operatios platform mlos platform MLS platform ow we'll see what is ml flow ow we'll just write here ml flow so ml flow is a platform for machie learig life cycle ow it is a ml Price look like this i the slow lae ow i the few miutes you will get to kow about what is this the latest versio is 2.2.2 it is a cloud package it is a cloud package we eed to istall this so this is default it will be there default default pytho it will be there o eed to istall ad here also this is padas also o eed to istall o eed to istall ad SQL ad also o eed to istall ml flow is the cloud package we eed to istall this okay ml flow is we eed to istall that first ml flow is there or ot there you just apply like this exclamatory Mark ml flow exclamatory Mark ml flow if you ru this if it is istalled you will get some to see somethig if it is ot istalled you will see commad ot foud okay you will see commad ot foud so that meas it is ot istalled so we will istall ow that is PIP istall ml flow simple if istall ml flow ow just istall this pip istall ml flow ow very good it is istalled so what it is istalled mac o databricks docker git database git pytho ad where is our ml flow here is ml flow you see right versus 2.2.2 ow the same thig we will ru here ml flow it is istalled ow so you will see somethig like this before what happeed if it is ot istalled you'll see commad ot foud after istallatio you ca see the some iformatio right this is good ow ext if you wat to see the versio also ow if you wat to see the versio ml flow versio so the latest versio is what 2.2.2 ow the same thig we have see here 2.2 it is released i 14th March oly so MLS is doe ow ext thig is import required packages I hope you clear the first poit right everyoe we istall a package i the step oe we istall a package i the step oe ow step two foreig what is that import required packages import required packages first package is import umpy as NP import ERS SP ow ow sql model ow I wat to give the iformatio here ow here I wat to use I wat to use a regressio model okay I wat to use a regressio model ame called elasticet the model ame is what elastic et model this is a model ame guys it is a regressio model you already kow what is the regressio model right regressio model is a supervised algorithm algorithm supervisor algorithm that meas we have iput will be there ad output will be there but output is output is i umerical data output is umerical data for this we ca use regressio algorithms that you already kow that is so what model I wat to use I wat to use a regressio model what is the ame of the model elasticet so ame of the model is elastic et data set I am takig is called wie quality data wie quality data what the data set ame is called wie quality data that meas I will tell you I will show the data set ad I will tell you what is your wie quality data ad platform we are usig Google collab otebook Google collab otebook ad the objective is here is objective what is your mai target is we eed to predict predict the quality of the quality of the wie so that is the data set ame is called wie quality data ad the model ame is called elastic et this is clear so ow from skl dot liear model dot liear model import elastic et will come automatically yeah elastic et that is doe ext from skl dot model selectio dot model selectio import trai test split I will tell you what is the tred test split I will tell you ext I wat to evaluate my model also right for that from skl dot matrix import these are some metrics these are some metrics mea absolute error mea squared error ad some R to score Do't Paic ow okay these are the some metrics those already kow about regressio aalysis they kow very well those who do't kow also do't eed to paic oce you lear you will easily uderstad oly thig is this will give your model performace okay if this will give your moral performace that's why we are sayig what metrics ad this is a skeleto is a package iside we have a liear model iside we have a elastic et agai sql is the package iside we have a model selectio ad we are importig trai test split I will tell you what is the strai test split ext oe is import ml flow ad we ca say import ml flow dot SK learig so these are my packages it is istalled ow step two is istall the packages is doe we are good at step two also right we are good at step two also yeah ow step three step three read the data read the data step three is read the data ow to read the data if you see here the file locatio is their files just click o this files ow you will see some Arrow will be there wheever you click o the files you will see some Arrow ow if you click o the Arrow I have some data sets will be there here I have wie quality red is there I am importig the data so ow the data is there why i quality red agai I'm repeatig guys we have some files locatio is there click o the files locatio click o the up Arrow it will redirect to your locatios okay ow iside we have oe data set will be there I uploaded that data ow I will read my data I will read my data ow data equal to PD dot read CSV PD dot read CSV I eed to provide the path iside I eed to provide the path there the three dots will be there here there are three dots will be there go to here there's a copy path will be available copy path ow copy that ad come to here ad ow apply data dot head it will give top five rows ow see this is my data it is my data fixed acidity volatile acidity citric acid these all are some chemical ames ow we have a Target is what called quality is our Target quality is our Target variable quality so these all are iput data sets ad this is our output colum it is a supervised learig ad it is a regressio problem it is a supervised supervised learig ad it is a regressio problem as simple as that ow just uderstad the data what are the colums are there o see first we'll uderstad how may rows ad how may colums are there that is give data dot shape so there are 149 ad rows are there ad 12 colums are there what it will give the iformatio this data set ad 12 colums are there 12 colums are there so i that 12 colums 11 colums are iput colums iput colum that is X ad oe colum that is what is the colum ame quality what is the colum ame quality ow quality is output colum output you ca say Target colum we geerally deoted by small y okay so we have 1 5 9 ad of course ad 12 colums i the 12 11 colums are iput colums ad oe colum is called is very good it is a regressio problem because we have quality is umerical data okay why it is a regressio problem quality is a target output colum output colum has umerical data umerical data so that's why it is called regressio yes very good umerical colum ow you got the poits very good that is excellet ow data dot shape ow that is completed ow you ca see data dot colums also i the quick way so our iterest is we are ot doig ay EDI here our iterest is to deploy model o the mloffs what is our iterest is our iterest is model developmet model developmet ad deploymet to develop a model to develop a model make sure we have all the colums all the colums have umerical data why umerical data mathematics math works oly o umbers oly o umbers so if ay categorical data is there we eed to covert ito umerical so first we will check where the umerical data is there or ot for that data.ifo will apply data.ifo ow it will see all our types of float float float o umerical ode categorical data all our umerical data we are put ad there's o ull values also see all our ormal it is a colum umber called fixed acidity umber is 159 error rows ad it is a o ull values ad data type is float 64. we are good you ca check this also data dot is ull dot sum if ay ull values is there for the correspodig colum wise it will give the sytax so we do't have ay ull values so we are good we do't have ull values ad we have the data is umerical way so we ca create our model developmet that is a step four ow step four step four just write like this model developmet usig ml flow ow here I wat to show you how the model developmet Geeral will happe okay so step oe is this is a very very importat step guys we eed to uderstad this is okay what I am tellig you is ow importat everyoe should uderstad first we divide we divide data ito two parts two parts oe is traied oe is traied data ad aother oe is test data okay we divide i two parts oe is traied data ad aother is test data ad secod is trai data as iput ad output tested data also as iput ad output agai we divide we divide traied data trai data ito iput data ad okay iput data ad output that meas iput colum separately output colums operatig so that we ca say exit trai ad wide trai simple we divided iput colum separately ad output colums separately ad the the same way we divide test data ito X test data ad Y test data first of all trai data data device data ad test data both havig iput colums ad output colums so we are separatig ito Excel trai y trai XO test ad Y test ad the model developmet model developmet happes o trai data o traied data model developmet will happe o trai data so ext step is model developmet will happe traied data the oce your model is created you eed to test right so I wat to model test so I wat to model predictios model predictios happes o X test data accept test data so this will give this will give y predictios very simple guys I have created my model the I wat to check my model is performed well or ot so I will pass X test ad model it will give some values that is we are callig y predictios fially fially I will compare I will compare my y predictios with Y test why predictios why predictios with Y test so this is the etire flow ow I just wat to show you maybe for write up you will cofuse but I will show you ow here how it will happe just see origial data iput colums are X1 X2 XP output colum is y we divide ito four parts trai data test data agai trai data is extra trai while trai X test y test what does that mea thik like that you have a data is like this you have a data is like this X is oe two three four Y is oe four ie sixtee twety five First Step Oe is divide ito two parts trai data test data the exitrai y trai X test y test ow come here this is the tred at first three observatios is the trai data last two observatios are the test data so it is a trai data extra trai white trai test data is a last observatio XO test y test ow my model is applied o which data trai data so I created a model called Y is equal to x square ow I will pass 4 to the Y is equal to x square I will get a predictio called 16.\": 0,\n",
       " \"I will pass Y is equal to Phi to the x square I will got the prestified so my predictios are what 16 ad 25 ow I will compare the 1625 already existed 16 ad 25 so this is the compariso so this is geerally ml developmet flow will happe I hope this is clear right uderstadig this is very very importat guys so you geerally divide the data that's it you geerally divide the data ito two parts that's the trai data ad test data ad agai EXO trai ad Y trai so to do to do all these thigs to do all these thigs we have trai test split Eglish ame Commo Sese Eglish commo Eglish ame trai test split it is a SK L package what is this sql package so what I will do is I will divide I will divide my data ito 70 30 ratio 70 30 ratio that meas out of 5159 observatios of 70 percet of 70 percet is my trai data okay out of 1599 observatios 30 percet is my test data ow ad also I will divide trai ad test data radomly I will divide radomly that meas the idea how will be like oe two three four five like this oe ad so oe five ie  will be there so I will divide the trai data I will pick first fifth observatio I will pick 10th observatio I'll pick 500 observatio radomly I will pick okay y will pick radomly to avoid the bias to avoid the bias what is mea by bias suppose u r a you are a fa of Virat Kohli okay you are a fa of Virat Kohli I will call you I will ask you who is your favorite cricketer what you will say you'll say Virat Kohli oly suppose Sharma ad I will ask you who who is your fa Roy Sharma you will say so if I pick you the bias this is the bias if I pick the radomly this output might be differet this output might be differet this output might be differet so Cosolidated my model will give that good output so that's why Always divide the data radomly do't go with order okay oe oe two thousad is a traied data trai data ad oe zero zero oe two sixtee hudred is a test data this will give the bias do't go like this first thousad observatio pick radomly secod 1600 observatio agai pick radomly so this we will do what we will do divide data ito 70 30 ratio ad pick the observatios i the radomly ow we will do that okay how we'll do that here so trai is oe test is aother oe so I will apply trai test split trai test split iside I eed to pass my data ad I eed to pass my test size is equal to 0.3 what is this mea we are dividig data ito sevety thirty percet ow I will apply radom state radom State equal to you ca give ay umber oe two three four you ca give oe two you ca give aythig you ca give radomly it will pick okay ow trai dot shape ad test dot shape okay ow see out of 159 observatios oe oe ie observatio is your trai data 480 observatios are your test data ow if I go for trai dot head trai.head I will see radomly it is speakig first of the reaso is what 642 secod observatio 678 third four oe two fourth oe sevety three good right these are great actually we are dividig ito 70 30 ad we are applyig radom so if we got divided traied data ad test data ow we eed to divide X to trai ad ow ow divide data ito EXO trai trai X ad trai y iput colum output colum separately we already kow ow trai X equal to out of this all the colums if I remove this quality if I remove this quality remaiig colums are what trai data remaiig colums are traied data so trai dot drop I am droppig a colum quality quality I'm droppig so it is a colum so we eed to give X is equal to 1. so that's the trai data i the same way test data Test X so test data dot drop agai same quality comma X is equal to 1. so we divided iput data i the trai data we divide we got the iput data ad test also we got the iput data ow we get the output oe trai why so out of this strai data if I select oly quality colum if I select oly quality colum that is my output data that is my output data so trai dot ow you ca select oly the quality that's it ow test Y is equal to test quality ow that's it we're doe ow you ca check your trai x dot shape dot shape ad trai y dot shape out of 12 colums 11 colums are iput colum ad oe colum is what output colum right see total trade observatios are triple oe ie i that 11 colums are your trai X ad oly oe colum is what trai y i the same way we have Test X ad test y dot shape four AIT is eleve that the test data ad oe colum is output data so we divided Tred test split is that clear rate till ow if radom state is 0 istead of pickig 642 it will pick aother value okay if you give aother radom state it will give you so how ca you pass suppose I am givig oe dot here if oe dot okay how may lies how may lies ca pass through oe dot tell me what is your aswer how may lies you ca pass through oe dot Ifiity yes like that radom State you ca give ay value it ca pick ifiite times maybe after 642 it will come after four oe two will come after 73 will come 678 will come last so wheever you chage this value the goal is fixed it will pick the radomly but the umbers will be differet that's all ow we'll go to the our mai step ow step fifth ow start ml flow step fifth start ml flow start ml flow yeah ext ml flow is a cloud algorithm ml flow is what ml flow is a cloud platform is a cloud platform ow what I my what is my task I wat to develop a model I wat to develop a model ad I wat to deploy I wat to deploy o ML flow oe he eed to deploy a ml flow ext suppose Abhishek Abhishek is created aother model oe agai you eed to create a you eed to deploy ml flow okay ow this yeah radom state that is a radom state is othig but agai I told you right it is a radomly it will pick that well radomly it will pick that that is a radom state okay I hope I give your aswer already yeah oe two three four that oly if I give radom State equal to oe two three four ow tell me like this oe comma 2 comma three comma four comma five six seve eight ie te ow radomly it will stop with oe after that how may combiatios will come secod letter how may combiatios secod letter will come how may combiatios third letter will come how may combiatio fourth letter will come radomly may right so that may we will provide by usig called radom state radom state if you give radom State equal to oe it will give oe order two three four like oe oe oe oe oe oe oe oe oe oe like this so wheever you chage your radom State the umbers will be chaged here that's why I am explaiig okay yeah so ext so uderstad this is guys this start ml flow is very very importat ow omkar creates oe model you wat to deploy a ml flow object created oe model he wats to display a ml flow that meas what ml flow will do ml flow will create some workspace some workspace for you some workspace i the ame of i the ame of experimet what is the ame here ame of experimet remember this ml flow will create some workspace i the ame of experimet so first we eed to create our experimet what we'll do first to create our experimet so that is ml flow dot set experimet set experimet I'm givig some path my path is ml flow ml flow ad you are givig mL of ml Ops workspace MLS workspace so this is my ame this is my workspace ame you ca create your ow workspace okay you ca give ay ame also you ca give arratio M also here okay you ca give your ame also that meas you are settig a experimet why you are settig your experimet there are thousads of people who ca create their model ad they wat to deploy a ml flow ml flow should uderstad what is your experimet ame what is your workspace ame that ml flow should uderstad that that's why we are creatig a experimet ame ow this experimet is ot there so you see here experimet with ame ml flow mL of workspace does ot exist so we are creatig ad this is your experimet ID ad this is the life stages active ad artifact locatio I will tell you what is artifact locatio it will go to this locatio this is the locatio path okay we'll just prit some values we'll just prit some values so prit I'll just copy this dot experimet ID I'm just givig experimet ID ad agai I am prit this because I wat to use that ID I wat to use that ID so life cycle stage is active agai prit ad you ca give ame also so if I prit all these three ow first oe is my experimet ID ame this is my experimet ID so ow this is your ID ow your workspace is active what is your workspace ame ml flow mL of workspace I hope this you clear ow right ca I get aswer i the chat box this is uderstadig is importat ml flow set experimet yeah code ow experimet is ready ow we'll go to the code ow we'll go to the code ow so I will create some fuctio call because I wat to write multiple times so what I will do is I will create some fuctio call So Def trai model deftrai model is my fuctio called ame so first step is what developed develop trai test split I wat to divide my data that I already show you how to divide the data so we'll just copy from there because we already did that so what I will do is I will take this I'm takig this this is I have doe separated to make you uderstad guys okay this add-o separated to make you uderstad because uderstadig that is very very importat ow this is we have take so this is importat so I just remove this I do't wat this okay ow your trai model is doe ow ow secod is iitiate the ml flow ow iitiate iitiate ml flow ow so we are iitiatig ow with ml flow dot start ru let us start ru is there ml flow dot start ru iside it is askig some experimet ID you eed to provide your experimet ID what is your ru ame okay you ca give your ame also ad you ca give a descriptio also so I am providig my experimet ID experimet ID what is my experimet ID so this is my experimet ID right this is my experimet ID comma my ru ame I wat to provide ru ame also that is it is a regressio it is a regressio ad I will provide the descriptio also it is a descriptio also I wat to provide what is the descriptio here aythig aythig you ca write performig a regressio aalysis so this all we ca see UI ow ml flow UI we ca see this all so this is the fuctio call so we are puttig colos here ad we are ruig this okay experimet ID a ru ame ad descriptio ow Now call ml model ow call ml model what is your ml model ame ml model ame is called elasticet so I ca give LR equal to I am takig a variable ame called LR because liear regressio so elastic et elastic et so iside what are the parameters are comig Alpha is the oe parameter ad L1 ratio is aother parameter there are two parameters oe is Alpha ad aother is L1 ratio so I am givig Alpha Alpha is equal to some Alpha I am providig ad L1 ratio L1 ratio equal to L1 ratio I'm providig because these are my parameters I wat to chage these parameters every time I created a ew model okay mid it that I wat to chage these parameters I am creatig a ew model so L1 ratio why this is error is comig because these are the parameters we eed to give you the fuctio also Alpha comma L1 ratio ow this will goe ow elastic et is there ow fit ow develop your model model developmet o which data trai data so trai X comma trai y this is your model is developed so model creatio is happeed ow what we'll do model predictio ow model predictio model predictio will happe o which data X test data X test data model predictio will be happe so that is predicted data predicted data equal to LR dot predict because your model is which ame is there LR so LR dot predict which data you eed to pass Test X so this is model predictio ow be careful guys just uderstad this three steps first trai test plate ext call the model ext fit the model ext model predictio so ext what we will do model evaluatio model evaluatio ow model evaluatio what are your evaluatio techiques you have take rmse this three mea absolute error mai square error R2 Square so model evaluatio will compare o which data which data model evaluatio predictios versus test data predictio forces test data so that we will do evaluatio ow that we will do evaluatio so here rmsc equal to NP dot square root NP dot square root mea squared error mea squared error bracket you eed to compare with your test y with the predicted data simple ow RMS RMS root mea square error guys RMS is othig but what root mea square error I will tell you what is the root mea square error so first error equal to your actual value y actual value mius y predicted value okay suppose actual value is equals 16 is there your model is predicted as 17. how much your error is gettig mius 1 like that so this is error ow we eed to mea square error so first we eed to square this ad the we eed to apply mea is othig but summatio of may observatios first observatio first error error oe secod observatio error 2. third observatio error 3. so you eed to combie all the errors Error 1 Plus error 2 Place error 3 error 3 ad this we are squarig Square 1 square 2 square 3 we are applyig a mea so this is called mai square error the ame itself what mea square error if you apply the root that is called rmse so this is a metric okay I'm ot goig to about much deal much deeper i that because that is ot our iterest right I just wat to give you a quick glace what is rmse it is a root mai square error that is a rmsc ext mea e m a is othig but mea absolute error these are the metrics these are the Matrix mai absolute error so agai same y test sorry test y comma predicted data agai R2 Square R2 is equal to R2 score of test y comma predicted data so this is the full plasma so we are callig model modal predictio modal evaluatio till ow is that clear everyoe foreig we will do that I am ot comig to that way okay we'll do that model register we will do okay we are goig step by step good ow you eed to log these parameters what is the ext step is importat is I wat to track my I wat to track my modal parameters ad model metrics ad model ame so this is called we are registerig we wat to register our models we wat to register our metrics we wat to register our parameters so for that what we will do is we eed to go for here we eed to log that parameters you ca prit also while doig you ca prit also I'll just prit this okay prit prit Mia sorry comma Mae ad prit that R2 score comma R2 score so we are pritig ow ext importat is what log The Matrix log this Matrix parameters parameters ad model o ML flow o ML flow okay so ow ml flow DOT log uder the log we have artifacts is there Matrix is there param scissor okay so we are goig for log param so log param o which ame I wat to log this my ame is Alpha Alpha is my ame I wat to log Alpha agai same ml flow DOT log param what is I what is the param ow L1 ratio L1 ratio is my param that is called L1 ratio so parameters are completed ow ml flow ow Matrix ow there are three metrics are there ml flow ml flow DOT log metric DOT log metric okay what is the metric first oe RMS is my metric ame whatever you give here ame that will be visible guys if you give your your ame that will be visible okay so rmsc ad same thig I wat to just copy here two times but here is Mia [Music] ad here Mae ad the here R2 square that is equal to R2 ow this is doe ow I wat to log what I wat to log my model also ml for ML flow Dot skl so we have already sql is there right skl DOT log model what is that DOT log model what is your model ame your model ame is what LR what your model ame LR so my model ame is called LR comma the ame is called modal ow what is your register model I wat to register my model I wat to register my model so registered model ame is equal to elastic et my model ame is called elasticet oce you created your LR model that will be uder the model it will register we will see that ow how it will happe ow I'm just ruig this okay ow what are the two parameters takig Alpha ad L1 ratio we are callig this trai model okay ow we are callig this so I am givig here suppose 0.3 ad I'm givig here 0.2 ow I'm ruig this ow see rmsc is this Mei is this ow you see successfully model is registered with ame what elastic et ad what is the versio versio is oe these are importat to otice what your model ame is called elastic et what is the versio versio is oe ow wheever you ru i the left side there is a ml rus folder will be created okay i the left side ml rus folder will be created if you click o the ml rus if you click o the ml rus there is a your experimet ID will be there if you otice this is your experimet ID guys okay go to here check your experimet ID where is the experimet IDC so this experimetary five six five three two five six five three to your experimet ID ow here your models is there i the model there is a model m is what elastic et that you give right elastic et that model you give here elastic et what is the versio here oly oe versio oly oe versio is there ow if you click o the versio if you click o this method.aml you will see what is the timestamp what is updated what is the ame what is the Ru ID this is importat what is the Ru ID with this ru ID if you go to your experimets the same ru IDs will be there here see same ru ID ow if you go to the iside ru ID we have five thigs oe is artifacts Matrix params ad tags Matrix meas what you log rmse Mia R2 that Matrix will come to here what is the value 0.51 see 0.51 is your value what is R2 0.23 is your value what is rmse 0.66 your value this is a matrix ad what parets you give Alpha ad L1 ratio 0.3 ad 0.2 so this is the artifacts artifacts is othig but your model that pickle will be available so your model ow you ca had over to cliet bios called Model dot pickle ad to ru this etire setup what is your requiremet.txt I eed ml flow This Cloud pickle pathlib sql typig extesio so everythig will be available here guys okay everythig will be available here so agai I am repeatig so just see here just otice this so this is ot the fial thig we eed to show this i the ml flow UI that is our ultimate goal okay ow see here wheever you created your ml flow workspace they clearly say artifact locatio is cotet ml rus three two five three two so wheever you ru your code it will create a ml rus iside it will create a experimet ID ow iside you are you have ru oly oe time right that's why oe ruide is created suppose I have ru two secod time ow see see the beauty here suppose I give a value is called four argumet value is called five ow same ame that meas I am ruig secod time uderstood the same ame I am ruig secod time that mea ow versio 2 should create right ow I ru this ow euro ew ru ID Now ew versio is created versio two ow you go here you go here just refresh this go to your models elastic et is your ame oly oly oe ame uder oe ame how may versios is created ow two versios versio oe versio two what is your versio ID what is your versio ID is your versio ID ow go iside the experimet ow you ca see seve to be user oe more IDE ad all your metrics will be ow here params everythig will be here so this is how it will works ml flow ow our mai goal is we eed to show we eed to show this o ML flow UI first of all are you uderstad till ow this yeah yes correct exactly two metrics we ca use may metrics Nai okay why we are drop quality we are ot droppig we are droppig ad we are processig here you see here okay that is the overall story right I'm sayig while you are passig you are creatig your model we are ot droppig you are passig your trai X ad trai y why is your quality oly okay ml models packages pytho packages will create such that you eed to pass your iput ad output separately that's why we are droppig okay ow everythig we are loggig ot oly rmsc meae there are so may metrics will be available oce you lear about data sciece course you will get to kow that okay ext ow you uderstad ow what is our goal is ml flow UI ow thik like this ow I wat to go to the ml flow UI so this is your Google collab otebook okay this is your Google colum book this is your ml flow platform this is your ml flow UI whatever you doe ow you eed to trasfer here right to do this to do this we eed to create some tuel what you eed to create a tuel tuel you eed to create ormal Eglish ame create so to coect Google collab to ml flow UI we eed to create a tuel what we eed to create tuel so I will tell you what is the tuel ow so ow I will give all aswers ow at the ed ow okay because it should ot miss the flow ml flow UI to ru to create to create ml flow UI from Google collab otebook Google collab otebook we eed to create a tuel we eed to create a tuel ad that tuel ame is called the tuel ame is grok what is the ame is called grok Remember the Name  grok what is the ame  Grog what is grok grok is your tuel who is created this way the road okay the compay ame the compay ame is grok what the compay will do it will create a tuel from your local collab otebook to your UI that is called tuel ormal Eglish ame it is a road the road compay ame is called grok compay ame is what  grok ow we will pip istall pip istall ad grog first okay I eed to istall that grok ow  grok is istallig ad grock is istallig ow  gruck is istalled ow what we will do is we'll try to create a tuel create a tuel ow create a tuel we will create a tuel so pip istall from pi ad grok import grok okay pi ad grok I thik we eed to istall pi ad grock I thik ot oly utritioal Pie Grove because grok is ot workig owadays will work okay ad grog they are removig egrock actually they are callig that the pi ad Croc so pi ad grok ad grog so ext we eed to create a tuel tuel ad grow I will give a ame called grok tuel I will give you ad grog tuel equal to  grok dot coect it is a UI right wheever you wat to coect a UI we eed to give some address also that address geerally people will give 5000 report okay ad prototype also we eed to give that is http so this is I do't eed to explai because there is a UI UI should be i our server so that's why we are givig 5000 port i the http ow what we will do will prit will prit a trackig URI a trackig URI with the ame of trackig URI I wat to track my  Grog uderscore tuel Dot Public URI ayoe ca access public URL I'm just clickig this okay very simple guys we are tuel this is a compay compay ame is called grok we are coectig with address 5000.\": 1,\n",
       " \"I'm just clickig this whe I clickig this what they are sayig traffic was successfully tuel to the grok aget but aget failed to establish ow we created a tuel successfully but this aget is ot givig permissio to create a UI why this is Aget is ot give permissio because you should ot provide a autheticated ID the aget does't kow the aget aget does't kow does't kow your ID your ID so that's why he is ot givig permissio he is ot givig permissio simple guys first what we are goig we are goig to a compay called grok to make a tuel from which place to which place Google collab Notebook 2 Google collab Notebook 2 your ml flow UI ml flow UI so we created a tuel but the tuel is ot givig permissio because we does't provide our ID ow what we will do we will provide our ID ow so get help with this error ow it will reach to here you just click o the logi just click o the logi ow whe you log i it will ask your email ID ad it will create with homecare.alagoi real gmail.com okay it wheever you log i it will ask your Gmail ID we already have Gmail ID is ope that's why it is goig directly ow go ito the your Autheticatio go to the or autheticatio ow this is your autheticatio ID okay I just pass ito the uh Google collab otebook okay like this I'm goig to edit as HTML I just copy this I'm just pastig i the Google collab otebook ad just paste here so that I ca access from here oly so this is my ID this is my ID so this is my auth ID so autheticatio ID autheticatio toke equal to this is my authority so my give my autheticatio ID ow same thig I will take okay same thig I am takig if you have autheticatio ID you do't eed to go to here guys okay o eed to go to here if you do't have autheticatio ID first ru this the it will redirect to oe place it will redirect to oe place ad the if you go to help it will redirect to aother place the logi it will redirect to your Gmail gmail.com from there you will get autheticatio toke directly copy for every email ID oe autheticatio toke will be available oe autheticatio toke will be available the postma we ca't use Abhishek here that's a differet case i the API testig so this is a creatig a tuels okay ow udershow right if you have autheticatio toke is there do't go directly here directly you ca write like this so I am creatig this here if already a tuel is established I wat to kill the tuel so I wat to do  grog.kill already a tuel is already existed I am killig the tuel okay so this is I ca say if ay tuels are there if ay ope tuels are there close that so for that  grok dot kill ow autheticatio toke ow ad ow said that  grok dot set Auto toke author toke your auth toke what is your author toke authorizatio uderscore to agai I have set my toke my set so I give my ID whe I give my ID I ca create the tuel ow simple step by step uderstad the steps if ay tuels are there kill the tuels cue your autheticatio toke set your toke ad create the tuel ow tuel is created okay ow we'll click o this whe I click o this ow see there is o error it is askig visit site whe it is askig visit site this is we are we are success we're good so for that we eed to ru ml flow UI we eed to ru what ml flow UI we eed to ru so ml flow UI wheever you ru ad the you go to here withi the site whe you visit the site it will create a UI see how beautifully the UI is ow agai I'm repeatig guys oe we provided autheticatio toke we ru this it will cost the visit site oce it is doe you eed to ru your ml flow UI util you work o this this code is still ru oly ow we'll just familiar with ML flow UI what is your experimet ID tell me what is your experimet ID ame what is your workspace ame what your workspace ame guys ml offs uderscore somethig oe right see this is your workspace ml flow ml Ops workspace how may times you model do you ru two times you have ru oe is 16 miutes ago aother is 12 miutes ago what is your model ame oe is first oe versio 16 miutes ago you have ru that is the oe versio oe 12 miutes ago you have ru that is versio two ow if you click o place you have Matrix is there your parameters is there you ca compare those also ow first time whe I ru that is 0.511 ad secod time 0.547 first time whe I ru 0.662 secod time 0.694 this way is othig but model trackig modal performace model moitor okay we'll go step by step agai this is ml flow workspace iside how may times you create a ru your model two times what is your ru ame regressio is your our ru ame what is your Matrix we already logged all these metrics ow I'm just clickig o regressio ow this is your ru ID this is your ru ID ad model is registered here model is registered o 2023 0 4 16. what is the ame of the model elastic et what is the versio is a V1 ow your model is registered this is your model.pickle file this is your amml file ml file will give you what what is the depedecies what is the PIP fuctios ad everythig this is your ml model everythig so if you dowload this if you dowload this you ca had out to your cliet he ca ru ad he ca get the output that's be some simple that is okay ow parameters uder this ru ID what are the values uder this ru ID what are the metrics ad what are the work model everythig that is your models artifacts ad everythig ad they also give your predictio code also you ca directly call this oe ad you ca do this so we'll go step by step agai okay first step go to your workspace uderstad this UI how may times you have ru two times what is your ru ame regressio what is your model ame elastic et go to your models how may what is your model ame elasticet what is your latest versio versio 2 click o this how may times you have ru two times oe is versio oe aother is versio two so it is trackig versio also if you ru oe more thig it is versio three it is versio 3. ow do you feel which versio of model is good do you feel do you feel which versio of model is good support is sayig sir my versio oe model is good versio oe model is good suppose Abhishek is sayig my versio model is good my versio is model is good ow there's a two steps will be there guys oe is stagig ad aother oe is productio okay stagig is othig but what stagig is othig but it is a Alpha versio Alpha versio productio is othig but beta versio that meas stagig is othig but it is o our local systems it is iteral use iteral use that meas we are ot give to the cliet to that those models are i the productio level that cliet ca use okay i outside idustry we have two thigs are there oe stagig will be there aother oe is productio is there I am thikig I am thikig versio oe versio oe is a good model is a good model that ca go ito the productio level is sayig that sir my versio oe model is good I wat to set up ito the productio level so for that what we will use we will go to the versio oe the the stage will be there trasitio to stagig trasitio to productio or you do't wat to use this model go to Archive so versio oe is model is good I wat to use i the productio the I am puttig the productio level ow I'll go to my elastic et I am goig to my models ow my elastic et is my model ame what is my latest versio versio 2 is my latest versio but what is i the productio productio is the versio oe is there i the productio ow you thik versio 2 is i the stagig ow go to i the versio 2 put i the stagig eviromet ow people will thik like that this versio 2 is ow i the stagig level already versio 1 is sedig ito the productio level so cliet ca use the versio oe model but versio 2 is i the iteral use oly still developmet is goig o that is the meaig of stagig level this is a meaig of productio level ad you ca go to the experimets ad you ca get the versio to model also from your workspace this is a versio 2 model this is a ru ID this is a metrics everythig will be there so this is we are loggig we are register the model we are deploy the model we are trackig the model we are model versioig is happeig ad fially i ext few miutes we will iferece the model also we will see so this is the beauty of ml Ops guys s ow I will give pass you ca ask me if ay doubts thak you Abhishek you ca put i the chat because we almost completed this ad oly the iferecig is there I will show the iferece also ow if you wat ppds mL of a third party server provider exactly rajwal mL of you kow the beauty of this oe uh how it is oly three guys are rollig here okay oly three guys i the world oe is gcp oe is AWS oe is azure okay ow what we'll do I am workig with Acceture right so called Acceture or TCS or Ifosys we do't have ay Cloud setup right we do't have ay Cloud setup what we will do we will pay the moey to will pay the moey to either gcp Service as a AWS service or Azure service so they will offer this mlos platform or automl so called like this they will perform like this so ml Ops ow databricks is there that is also you ca use ml office tie up with so may compaies ml flow like that so every ew data we eed to work o the lower eviromet oce we test i the stage exactly exactly that is the correct but we eed to create some Pipelies okay you will ot create automatically you every time you should ot go you should ot create you will create some Pipelies how the pipelies will be there data igestio ad the data pre-processig pre-processig ad data Eda ow Eda is the very biggest star spread i the ideas there are so may drop tasks will be there feature selectio will be there feature egieerig will be there so may thigs will be there ad the we'll deploy a models ad the you log eter everythig yeah yeah that is the GitHub actios is importat ow you you I developed a suppose i my team ivitig five members are there okay five members are there I have worked I have worked o model developmet okay you are workig you are workig o Eda okay some other perso is workig o data igestio we all created dot py files oly dot py it's also dot py file oly this is also dot P Wi-Fi oly ow this all dot pofi ow I there's a GitHub is there ow you will push your code i the GitHub or GitHub or devops whatever it is you will push your record i the GitHub GitHub ad this guy also put your code i the GitHub there's a oe guy is there devops guy there's a oe guy is the devops guy what he will do he will Cosolidated our course Cosolidated our codes ad he will trigger the pipelie so that course ca be updated course ca be updated oce course ca be updated with ew code with a ew code your pipelie tree will trigger your ml flow will be triggered so that is called git actios that is also we will ed i our arratio so ew data ever go directly to the plot o ever produce productio level cliet should use cliet will ask may questios you kow you kow right how may cliet will ask the questios they ever uderstad aythig but we eed to explai to them everythig so ever go directly actual Adroid is what is happeig right so I am workig a compay called make SM okay ow make a si so we are developig some ml models to the vacatio we are developig some ml models ow the makers ad the data from the data they are gettig from PWC PWC that meas PWC is respodig for data they will give the medicie ow make a set equal to the Acceture ow data egieerig guys will do the data igestio ow data sciece will guide to the model developmet ow ml egieerig I will do the mL of both are same you are doig the same task owadays ow these guys always talk with PWC data ow this guy will say exted to the makasa how it is happeig ad everythig like that yeah yeah Rosha you ca cotact with admi we are we are startig that MLS batch so oce cliet everyoe certified share will push the product correct vekat you're absolutely correct our model do Ed automatically yeah we eed to create some Pipelies okay but this you eed to cotact with uh admi okay yeah we'll create a Pipelies so it is ot over those completed data sciece so we ca uh data sese it is good for two data sciece also if you kow the good go to data sese the you ca do that or you ca call to uht we will give a clear guidace o this actually we have oe more step is there guys okay wait for last miute okay we have oe more step is there what is our oe more step we reduce the predictios just copy this okay I'm just stoppig this ow okay ow this is my model this is my model which model versio 2 model I am loadig my model I wat to pass my test text the I will get my outputs these are my outputs if ay ew data will come they'll directly pass here ad they will get the output as simple as that because this is a free versio that's why we are stoppig ad we are ruig ad we are goig ad checkig there's a paid versios will be there actually if you pay that the you ca do automatically this that thig if this is a prepared versio is ot a paid versio that's why we are stoppig here whe you stop your ml flow will goe does UI will goe so that is a simple drawback here because we are usig a free versio right that's why so ow this is a ed to ed ml flow guys I hope you uderstood the everythig flow okay I hope that we have a very good sessio we have very good sessio you uderstad some extet some extet you uderstood how the life cycle how the data sciece life cycle will happe life cycle will happe so I'm expectig that you ca you ca say that i the chat also eed to Deep dive more yeah this is a simple task Workshop is ot like that Workshop is ot like that it is a simple like it is a first task so that i the goig o we ca do more tasks also that is but what we lear what is ml villai ad ext types of ml villai ad we lear data sciece lifecycle we lear ad we have see some good examples also why we eed ml Ops N2 ad ed to ed flow of mL of ad we lear about practical implemetatio practical implemetatio usig ml flow ml flow so we covered may thigs yeah yeah if ay ay course related because I am a traier right I uh that ay course related ay course related okay erollmets ad everythig the admi guy is there at aresh ID so admi guys are very they are Cooperative they will explai each ad everythig for you you ca cotact to directory we always try to give the best teachig ad best Cocepts to you we always yes defiitely Pawa because data sciece people kow oly what you kow oly to create models right yeah tfx everythig you're correct airflow could be flow everythig will be there you're right yes i

learig operatios that is ml Ops so this sessio is both Theory ad practicals okay Theory ad practical practically about ed to ed flow ed to ed flow of mlos mlos so that is the first thig it is a both icludes Theory as well as practicals ad this sessio is about two hours I'm expectig for two hours it might be good for 2.5 hours also because this is a very very importat topic we eed to coect with cloud ad we eed to Showcase that how it is works ad I will take all the questio ad aswers I will give some pass i Middle as well as at the ed so all q ad a sessio you ca take at  most probably you ca ote your questios I will give each ad every oe aswers okay ad first of all I eed oe cofirmatio how may of you kow about data sciece data sciece ad machie learig three parts oe preset four five yeah it's a good umber of people or kows that's very appreciate that but this sessio is etered from scratch level okay so I will go with scratch from do to uderstad high level flow that meas both Techical ad o-techical people ca uderstad I ca say that so this sessio is from scratch some scratch those who do't kow about machie learig do't kow about machie learig also they ca Now uderstad at least what is machie learig those who already kow about machie learig they kow about what is ml operatios how it is workig exactly so that is our ed goal so there are two face of cadidates I'm seeig here oe kows ML ad oe do't kow about ml but do't worry I will give from scratch level uderstadig you ca uderstad easily i the both levels so comig to the myself I am omkar alagoi um curretly workig as a seior data scietist seior data scietist seior data scietist with Acceture so I have total seve plus years experiece i ID traiigs i it ad traiigs ad this seve plus years experiece completely relevat ad data sciece ad mL of ad some part of data Egieerig also that is the cloud operatios everythig ad I have completed my PG diploma PG diploma i data sciece from IIT tirupati IIT tirupati as well as I have a certified gcp ml egieerig ml egieerig ad I have a certified i the Staford Uiversity Staford Uiversity deep learig course so I ca say it is a deep learig code that is a cs-232 course ID is so that's all myself so we will quickly go to the our sessio ow yeah it's okay eve though if you are a Java studet if you are ot a IT backgroud studet this will uderstad that is ot a issue Pawa yeah this I will go from very scratch level I'm just sharig my scree here ad the today our topics to be covered is what is machie learig because what is machie learig we are usig ad what is the types of machie learig data sciece of life cycle ad after that what is mL of why we use mL of mL of ed-to-ed workflow ad fially we will Implemet practical implemetatio of ml Ops usig ml flow okay why we are goig for machie learig types of machie learig data Scieces here there are all type of cadidates will be available some people kow about data sciece some people kow do't kow about that assigs so that's why bear with us those who are already kow about machie learig okay so let's start the sessio so first oe what is machie learig why it is importat so i my case I ca I ca say easily so here I'm just goig to the show preseter View ad just ask Barts yeah data sciece data sciece ad measure or machie learig machie learig is a part of a data sciece okay machie learig deep learig NLP is a part of data sciece ml is a moder astrology moder astrology I ca proudly say this moder astrology what you will do i astrology i astrology i astrology you will predict the future you will predict the future but without ay evidece without ay evidece but data sciece ad machie learig will predict the future DS or ml i the shortcut data sese is the DS machie learig is ml will predict the future predict the future with evidece with the solid evidece with solid evidece I ca say solid evidece ad this evidece comes from some mathematical algorithms this evideces comes from mathematics mathematics algorithms so those those mathematical all algorithms mathematical algorithms we are sayig machie learig algorithm simple we are sayig ml algorithms very simple so machie learig is geerally it is the predict somethig by usig mathematics that's all ad that mathematics based o that we will develop so may ml algorithms like suppose I will give oe example okay provide me your compay employees attritio or the previous history suppose you have a compay called some Google compay is there take the example ow Google give me a data they're the previous employees history those who are every year those who are leavig the compay if you give me the data I will aalyze the patters I will aalyze the patters ad I will say i the ext couple of the years i the ext years how may people how may employees will stick with your compay how may employees stick with your compay stick with your compay we ca say that suppose you are a sales you are a dmod ower you are a dmart ower you wat to idetify your loyal customers loyal customers give me give me employees sorry give me customers customers trasactio data customer trasactio data I ca say who are your loyal customers who are your loyal customers I ca say that suppose you are a bak maager suppose you are a bak maager you wat to idetify whether a perso ca pay the loa or do't pay the loa you ca pay the loa or do't pay the loa do't pay the loa give me give me your M customers data previous data I ca say easily you ca pay the loa or do't pay the loa this is all our use cases these all our use cases that you ca predict the compay future by usig called machie learig what machie learig will geerally do it will aalyze the data aalyze the data ad patters it idetifies some patters Idetify some patters i the data patters i the data usig mathematics usig math so I will give a example everyoe kows a movie called super 30 right supercetig that's the famous Aad Kumar biography is a IIT traier i that there is a scee called Truth Rosha wet to a hotel okay he will say to the hotel guy your hotel will ot ru i ext two years will ot ru i ext two years he will say that if you remember that ad he will say your hotel will ot rai ext two years that hotel will shock how it is happe the come up with some calculatios okay so mathematics ad if the the hotel guy will believe so that is the power of mathematics if you people if you say the statemets people will ot people will ot covice coveyace with statemets people will covice with umbers should talk ot statemets that is the beauty of data ad Aalysis people will covice with them if I say Usai Bolt will 100 meters ru he ca do i the eight secods if I say that you will ot believe but if I show the statistics of Usai Bolt you ca defiitely believe so that is the power of mathematics ad those we are implemetig the machie learig algorithm but how this will happe how this will happe how this will happe how this will happe how the patters are happeig how the patters are happeig everythig how they are thikig ow everyoe talkig about AI ml deep learig they're talkig about that how these patters are happeig I will give oe example i our families we have a kids is there right small kids you wat to trai your kid trai your kid with some iformatio some iformatio trai your kid with some iformatio what is the iformatio example oe okay example oe you are watchig a TV you are watchig a TV okay ow you say you say to your kid your kid this is a TV this is your TV ow because the kid is a huma beig huma he ca uderstad he ca uderstad what you say ad he will uderstad some patters you will uderstad some patters what is the patters first patter it is a rectagular box it is a rectagular box secod patter some color colors are there obviously i the TV some show is ruig colors will be there right some colors are there ad third poit some cartoo people also there you'll uderstad the cartoos you do't kow about Shahrukh Kha you do't kow what Salma Kha is comig i the TV right he will simply uderstad the cartoos so these patters he ca uderstad that meas he uderstads the patters he's ot a system his erve system is uderstadig the patters that is we are talkig about euros owadays i the Deep learig ow secod example ow secod example you wet to the theater you wet to the theater or Mall to watch a movie to watch a movie ow ask a questio to your kid ow ask a questio to your kid ask a questio your kid what is this what is this ow based o his patters what is his patters his rectagular box theater screeigs rectagular box yes some colors are goig yes some cartoos are goig yes the what is you'll say aswer he will say mama this is a TV ow you will say o it is wrog it is wrog it is ot a TV it is a theater the he will uderstad he will add the fourth patter okay it's a big scree some big rectagular scree is there big rectagular scree is there so that he will uderstad okay if it is a small rectagular box is there it is a TV if it is a big rectagular box is there it is a theater ow ask the third example ow watch movie i laptop watch movie i laptop ad ask the questio what is this ow he already kow about the small thig is Stevia ad big thig is rectagular that is a theater he will either because he is a huma beig he ca uderstad the patter he will either say he either say TV or say theater because he kows he is a huma beig the same thig how you are traied the iformatio how you are traied the iformatio how this guy is uderstadig the patters if that iformatio you are testig with ew data textig with ew data ow you are uderstadig whether he ca say right aswer or wrog aswer if it is say right you are happy your model is good if it is wrog agai you are tradig with ew data so that's where that's where the machie learig will applicable actually so that's what is patters how our huma beig i midset we are discussig about patters i the same way the mathematics also will discuss the patters the mathematics will geerate the patters ow if you see here we are sedig a traied data we are creatig some ml algorithm the model is created ow i the same way you are providig you are a TV you are providig a theater ow you are askig a questio what is this he might be predicted somethig so that predictio you will do evaluate whether he say good okay if you say wrog agai you eed to trai with the dose data so that way machie learig all Gardes will works I hope those who are do't kow about machie learig ow we ca some extet he ca kow about the what is machie learig right ca I say yes or o i the chart you ca give me replay i the chat also I ca pass oe miute yeah thak you so ext ext we have some types of learigs will be happeed because there are so much data is there right ad the data is a huge data will be there so that's why what they are doig machie learig people they are dividig some types i that oe type is called supervisor learig supervisor learig ad aother type is called usupervised learig oe more type is called reiforcemet learig it is very easy guys supervisor learig meas suppose you have a use cases there i the use case you have some iput data is there ad output data is there so what is iput data ad what is output data ow comig to this Bak data suppose suppose you go here so this is a bak data some loa ID is there some geder is there educatio is there self-employed applicat icome loa amout loa amout term is there ad loa status so what is the objective of this data you eed to idetify the customer whether we ca grat a loa him or ot that is objective the objective is so for this loa IDK 1002 what is the status yes you are grated a loa you are ot grated a loa okay so these kid of data if you see that meas this loa ID geder educatio employed these are we ca say iput colums what we ca say iput colums ad what you are seeig loa status we ca say this is output colum because you wat to predict somethig so tomorrow I am goig with my ID I am a male cadidate I am a graduate I am ot a self-employed ad the my applicat icome is there so whether he ca provide the loa or ot that meas i the data you have some iput data will be there ad output that I will be there if you see that kid of thig we ca say this is a supervisor learig we ca say so I have see some participats raise their hads but I will pass i Middle you ca ask your questio i the chat at the time I will defiitely aswer okay ow ext uder the shoe I kow we got what is supervised learig here so I'll just give a example here Super Wise to the learig supervised learig meas we have some iput data will be there iput data will be there ad correspodig we have output database also will be available output data but agai i the iput data ad output you have a supervised learig i that supervisor learig agai we have oe more techique is called classificatio classificatio techique ad secod oe is we ca say regressio techique classificatio regressio what is the geeral Eglish meaig of classificatio guys what the geeral meaig of Eglish class meaig classificatio you are classified somethig classified somethig okay you are you are classificatio somethig like s or o some zoes like support covet Joes owadays Kobe Joes what is that gree zoe gree zoe orage Zoe Red Zoe some classificatio some parts are fail pass or fail these are the classificatio so here i the data here loa status is y is there ad loa status is o is there s is there o is there it is a classificatio so first questio is do we have output data yes do we have output data if thus output data is a categorical or ot ow ext questio is if that output data output data is i the form of categorical categorical some Eglish ames categorical the it is called classificatio techique simple so ow I will a questio this is a supervisor learig or ot this data is a supervised learig or ot yes it is a supervised learig how ca we are sayig it has iput data is there ad it has output data also there so it is a supervised learig ext questio it is a classificatio problem or regressio problem ow check the output if output is a categorical data of umerical data output is a categorical data so it is a classificatio problem ow oe more example I will take ow here my objective is predict the total umber of sales based o the advertisemet cost o differet medium I have a ower of some so so I am a ower of D Mart okay I wat to icrease my sales so what I decided I wat to sped some moey o some advertisemet advertisig so I sped some moey o TV ad ewspaper ad social media I wat to predict my sales if I sped this much what is my sales 2000 if I sped this much what is my sales it is a 1950 so first of all do you idetify the iput here what is your iput colums here TV ewspaper social media what is your output colum sales ow tell me it is a supervised learig or ot yes it is a supervised learig but if this your output is a umerical data or categorical data it is a umerical data ow output is output is a umerical data umerical data so if it is a umerical data the that model we called regressio model what is the model called regressio model so that is the supervised learig that is the first oe ad ext oe if you see here ext oe is called usupervised learig usupervised learig so usupervised learig is very simple guys supervised learig we are seeig some output data is there i the usupervised learig we do't have output data very simple we do't have output data what is the example for that ow see here the example for this this is called the objective is segmet or group the customers based o the aual icome ad spedig source ow you are a d Mart ower ow you have some customer IDC is there their age is there their geder is there ad the aual icome also there ad the spedig scores every moth the customers are comig to your market ad they are spedig somethig moey ad you are givig some spedig score based o the spedig score you wat to idetify whether they are a rich customers or poor customers they are importat customers are ot importat customers you wat to group them so here there is o output data your our use case is I wat to segmet the people I wat to divide the people how may people are my rich customers how may people are my poor customers I wat to divide those groups so that's why it is called it is a usupervised learig so that is the thig ad what you are seeig is called some algorithms like I said machie learig is developed by mathematics so that mathematics we are callig ml algorithms so agai machie learig is to divide it to three parts supervised ad usupervised so uder supervise you have some classificatio problem is there ad you have regressio problem is safe so classificatio meas you have a output data that is the step oe ad ext that output data is categorical the go for these may algorithms decisio trees Navi bias svm do't worry about these algorithms okay but just uderstad the high level View uderstad the high level view first of all machie learig is mathematics simple I will give you a fuy example I'll see you at this you have a data is there whe X is equal to 1 Y is equal to oe X is equal to Y is equal to 4 X is equal 3 Y is equal to 9 x equal to 4 Y is equal to 16 whe I say x is equal to 20 what Y is equal to tell me what is the Y is equal to put i you are aswerig the chart I just wat to see your yeah very good 400. how did you say this 400 how did you say this 400 because i your mid you created some mathematics equatio that is called Y is equal to x square this is ml algorithm guys this is a simple ml algorithm based o the previous data based o the previous data you predicted oe ml algorithm the you are sedig this x is equal to 20 to this algorithm it is givig Y is equal to 400 simple that's it ow thik about imagie as a big data is there for the Big Data you eed some calculus ad algebra mathematics we will develop some mathematical equatio like this so those mathematical algorithms we have give some ames that's all but mathematics is very simple mathematics that we are usig that is algebra algebra ad calculus all geographical so oly simple mathematics we are ot doig ay itegratio or differetiatio that we are ot usig here simple algebra ad calculus we will develop some ml models I hope people should uderstad ow what is exactly ml model meas this is your history data you created a ml model ow so ow people already created some more ml models by usig some mathematics we are usig that ow these are the some usupervised learig algorithms ad supervised learig algorithms do't worry about algorithms agai I am sayig that algorithms is othig but some mathematics simple algorithms is othig but a mathematics ow comig to the reiforcemet learig reiformig is geerally aget agets should respod with our actios like iPhoe Siri okay iPhoe series is a hey Siri what is the time ow if you say us it will give us some time right so that is a reiforcemet learig so ow robotic self-drivig cars Alexa these are the reiforcemet learig Earth Gardes so that's why we call so so I called AI owadays yeah ow if you see i 2019 I thik i 2019 our ISRO uh do for magala 2. okay that is for the moo they actually should lad at some place but due to the evirometal coditio it is ladig some other place that's why it is failed here whe it is ladig it is ot able to Ladig successfully because the evirometal coditios is ot able to respod that aget so they implemeted the AI coditio i the ISRO eviromet but obviously the moo coditios is differet there's a rocket sciece it's ot a easy task so that's why we got some failure but is 95 success that is so like that way the reiforcemet learig owadays the so much moey they are spedig o this reiforcemet learig so this is about the machie learig ad the types guys so I will give oe pass here okay I will give oe pass ad all the cluster algorithms are usupervised algorithms yes you are correct all cluster algorithms are called usupervised learig clusterig othig but groupig or segmetatio your characterizatio if you have ay doubts you ca ask me I will give oe miute we do't kow cluster what is oe me we do't kow cluster how to pursue this course yeah this is a data sciece course that will be talk about maagemet okay yeah yes that is aother city that is our mai evet we'll talk about this all these thigs but at least you ca idetify the high level view right what is machie learig what is data sciece everythig yeah the you ca easily lear about cluster algorithms that is that you ca say ext what is the reiforcemet Ledig yeah course cotet I will that admi will take care of okay that is ot our Workshop thig okay ow okay we'll go to the ext thig that admi will take that first you uderstad the cocept ed to ed flow agai at the ed we will discuss about your doubts okay but i the middle I wat to kow the specific questios that is related to your Cocepts ow some people are algorithm reiforcemet learig algorithm they are askig so reiforce rederig algorithms is completely a algorithms okay that is you ca kow huggig phase Trasformers there's a example that is we ca say huggig phase Trasformers or robotics or Trasformers are there there is a call huggig face Trasformers okay huggig face huggig face or you ca say YOLO there's a YOLO algorithm is there you look oly oce okay you look oly oce you ca test type YOLO you will idetify image objects for self-drivig cars or movig objects they will idetify like this there are some algorithms so ext this is a very very importat guys what is a data sciece life cycle what is a data sese life cycle so of course I told you agai I leared mathematics Islad everythig I wat to implemet the programmig laguage I eed required is pytho okay those who are learig about pytho it is a very good course agai I am sayig that why this is pytho is a tool pytho is a tool pytho is a tool but data sciece is a subject it is a subject okay cyber security cyber security is a subject okay iot is a subject I what is a subject like that ad cloud computig cloud computig is a subject okay cloud computig subject those who are learig the tools my best advice is lear ay oe of the subjects so that you ca master that subject ad there's a so much lifespa i the IIT carrier okay pytho is a tool those who are learig pytho the best choice is data sciece that is ed to ed you ca kow that so ext so data sciece life cycle guys this is the data so ay data sciece lifecycle ot all ay data sciece lifecycle guys suppose you I am a you are a data scietist I am a customer I am some HDFC Bak okay I'm HDFC Bak customer I wat to kow that my customer home loa capacity so first ad most importat is what you eed to uderstad about busiess problem okay first of all what is your problem is the HDFC bak is comig to you ad they will have some help for you the first what is that you eed to uderstad about busiess problem what is your problem oce you uderstad the problem oce you uderstad the problem you eed to collect the data the HDFC bak will provide data to you hfc bak will provide the data to you ext this data might be a structured data or ustructured data data might be a structured data or ustructured data so this data might be a structured way or ustructured way okay ow what you will do you will make a data preparatio you make the data ito structured way or you are puttig ito some database ad ready to use some database you will make ito some database you are load all this data to the i this database ad the data is ready oce data is ready this is the heart of data sciece guys we call Eda exploratory data aalysis exploratory data aalysis what you will do i the data aalysis you will uderstad some isights uderstad some isight what is the iside what is the mea value what is the media value what is the mode what is the variace how it is goig the all statistical Cocepts what is the populatio how the sample is workig ad what is the hypothesis this is all a statistical Cocepts if you remember your childhood days we kow our statistics right so based o the statistics you eed to idetify based o statistics we eed to idetify Idetify some patters Idetify some patters we eed to idetify that so that's why EDI is a very very importat ad the oce EDI is doe we will develop our ml models so called mathematics models ml models you you said sir I created a model okay you said home cursor I created a model but how ca I kow your model is good or ot how ca you kow your Y is equal to x square is a good correct model or ot you developed a y is equal to x square ad you said Assad this is my model verify this how ca I verify by usig model evaluatio whether your model is correct or wrog I eed to do the modal evaluatio the fially your model is ready ad I eed to deploy your model deploymets what this HDFC bak I should use right you created your model here but HDFC bak I should use that is a model deploymet so this is a data sciece lifecycle guys you eed to uderstad the busiess problem data collectio data preparatio the step by step o eed to buy heart also this is this is commo sese I eed to uderstad the problem ext I eed to thik about solutio for to thik about solutio I eed some resources here resources is the data sciece I have data is there I eed to prepare the data i the orgaized way I data is prepared I eed to do some statistical aalysis because my duty is that data sciece duty is oly to uderstad the patters ow I eed to create a model my model is doe ow I wat to verify this model is good or ot that's the evaluatio the I eed to deploy the model because HDFC bak I should use ow data sciece is completed with this ow you created a model ow you created a model thik like this you created created a model I will take Y is equal to x square oly because that you created from your mid just ow okay I'm just kiddig but why is equal to sphere your model you created that model Y is called x square ow HDFC Bak should use that model HDFC Bak should use that model okay this Y is equal to x square you created a model by usig pytho code by usig pytho code is created by usig pytho code ow pytho code you ru i your local pytho code you ru i your local ow how ca HDFC guy use that how ca HDFC I use your model that is the questio umber oe questio umber oe how ca a cliet we ca call cliet use your model so this we are i IT idustry the term called productio okay what would be the term is called productio how ca a cliet use your model i the productio level how ca a cliet use your model i the productio level ad secod questio the cliet is sayig cliet is sayig that sayig that every moth every moth I will geerate geerate a ew data ew data how ca your model respod how ca your model respod o the ew data ad I should write my questio first you created Y is equal to x square ow how ca you had over to the cliet the productio level ext cliet is sayig that every moth I will geerate a ew data how ca your model is respod ow ext third questio is how ca you moitor you ca say moitor or track your model performace modal performace tell me these three questios that's it I'm good so this is your local everythig is your local but how ca you aswer this all questios so that's where we comig mlogs machie learig operatios ow see here after model developmet after model developmet we eed to ask some questios ourselves first questio is how ca we had over a developed model to cliet which meas how ca we deploy our model o productio level that is the first questio valid questio right this is a very valid questio because your model is developed i a local system i my computer I developed but how ca I had over to the cliet it's a valid questio ow how ca we trai our model agai o the fresh data ow oe like customers are comig i this moth April ad two lakh customers are comig i the Jue ow your model you your pytho code should be geeralized code right that code should trai o the ew data so that is the ext questio how ca we trai our model o fresh data i future o productio level ow third questio how ca we moitor or track our model performace ow this moth April moth oe lakh customers are there I created a model Y is equal to x square is my model my model performace is good I am gettig accuracy is equal 90 percet ow after Jue 2 lakhs customers are comig ow if your model is traiig o the fresh data Maybe your model is performace will drop 70 percet will come how ca you moitor or track the model performace so these are the all valid questios i the Cloud eviromet whe we are trasferrig ito the cliet productio level so there oe more thig is called how ca we maitai the ed-to-ed flow from data igestio to predictio like I told you right data is there ijectio ad you eed to do predictio so from here to Here There Is the Ed to Ed flow is there how ca you maitai this ed-to-ed flow for cliet so where to aswer all about questios our best practice is ml Ops ow see the sceario i the two ways guys oe is developig a model is oe way ad productio as the model is aother way productio level okay developed a model is a data sciece people will do so to do the Productios ml egieerig I will do ml egieerig very simple ml egieerig so I will say I will tell you a beautiful thig ow i the AI world of AI rules i the world of Errors there are three kigs are there first oe is the data egieer guy what data egieer guy will do cliet will come HDFC bak will put some data ito somewhere okay ow the data egieer respod is you eed to igest the data to make use of the data sciece okay that is the data egieer guy so I'm a data egieer my respose is what HDFC bak is givig a data to me I wats to put the data ito i the Some Cloud eviromet some database or SQL Microsoft SQL Server so that data sciece guy ca use the data that is a data egieer guy so this is a base level oe ow data is ready i the cloud data is ready i the database data is ready i the database okay the data sciece will come so what this value guy do you will uderstad the patters ad you will created a ml models it will create a ml models these are data sciece guy o third there is a ml egieer what this guy's respose is he will make use of this ml model to the cliet i the productio level cliets should use productio level so these are all importat people i the world of AI without these guys data egieer data scietist ad we ca say ml egieer so these three guys are very very importat so some maybe the model developmet does't kow about this guy okay the model developmet does't kow about this guy this guy kows model developmet this guy kow how to make ito productio okay but as a good idea guy we eed to kow about how the data sciece algorithms will work ad how the ml egieer should work ow yeah I hope you uderstood right the rules how the roles are distiguished data egieer will igest the data data scietists will do develop the model ml egieer will do productioize the model so this is the rules of i the three people so you ca say ml Ops is a level three level three so I will just show you here for you make you easy I will just write here step oe igest the data step two develop ml models step 3 make use the ml models i the productio eviromet the productio eviromet so this guy is a data egieer guy this guy is a data sciece guy ad this guy is a ml egieer guy MLG so where our ml Ops will come to here everyoe else will come to here so data egieer guys Place data sciece guys will closely work each other closely work each other ow data sciece guys plus ml egieerig guys will closely work to each other closely work each other but they were igestig a data idustry data is a very hectic task okay there are so may people will requiremet here much people eeded here much people eeded here i the same way MLG Egieerig also much people required here because puttig i the productio level is ot a easy task okay so that's why I always remember data sciece ad MLG is the part this both combiatio if you kow about data sese ad MLG the you will lead the idustry you ca lead IIT easily data sciece ad MLD o I kow I hope you have some broad picture ow but I just wat to repeat agai I just wat repeat agai so we have started with our machie learig what is about machie learig ad we kow about types of machie learig ad we kow about data sese life cycle ad after model developmet what is the questios you eed to ask yourself ad the for to all these questios to aswer we go for MLS okay ow good high up till ow you uderstad right everythig the high level flow ca I expect yes yeah to uderstood the high level flow yeah the questios I will take I will aswer all the questios do't worry guys because this sessio is for you oly okay this sectio is especially we are set up for you oly to clear all your high level doubts clarificatios we'll take olie offlie also both yeah we'll talk that at the ed okay ow see ml Ops is the full form is called machie learig operatios that is clear what is mL of score fuctio is machie learig is focused o machie learig models through the productio that oly I am tellig right machie learig models to the productio ad the you eed to maitai ad you eed to moitor very simple guys you eed to put that i the productio ad moitor so mL of is a collaborative fuctio of a data scietist guys ad devops guys it's a combiatio thak God I am workig some mL of project so eve though I'm a data scietist so that I kow about ed to ed flow so I very much thak to God because I have your opportuity to work with ML Ops also because I do't wat stick as a guy with oly I kow models I kow the iterest I wat to kow about ed to ed flow you should be ethusiasm like that so that's why we are here to teach you ow why we eed mlos ow you already have a aswer why you eed MLS because machie learig life cycle is a very complex life cycle you eed to igest the data you eed to apply Eda you eed to do feature egieerig you eed to do the model traiig you eed to about model performace you eed to the predictios you eed to deploymet moitorig ad you eed to do the automated model traiig that is there's so may life cycles are there but these life cycles are trust me guys you ca ejoy this you ca ejoy literally if you kow about this data sciece ad ml Ops you will ejoy the life you ca you oly do the so much work because these all are r d this is all our r d it is ot like a daily routie toss it's ot agai like a rotat us it is like a complete R ad a research ad developmet we are i that so you kow about why we eed mlos ow this where is a very very importat thig guys mL of ed-to-ed workflow first two step is what ml developmet ext ml developmet you eed to create a traiig operatios what is the traiig operatios I will tell you so i ml developmet after ml developmet that meas I ca say ml developmet here step oe ml developmet is there what is ml developmet you will do you will do data igestio you will do okay data igestio you do you will do data preparatio you will do ow you should't you should say the steps ow okay you do data preparatio you will do Eda ad you will do model buildig model buildig ad you will do evaluatio this is all your steps you do data igestio data preparatio Ada model buildig evaluatio we will do that's clear this everythig you will make oe setup guys you will make create a DOT py file dot py file ad some cofig file some cofig file you will create some dot py file some cofig file what is cofig file I hope I ca show you that give me oe miute give me oe miute guys I ca show you the some cofig file so this is a cofig file you see this is the cofig file I have created what is the Q a maker Commuity Services what is the storage Services what is auto complete Services I'm creatig some ames so that I ca use my pytho code okay do't do't worry about Do't Paic about that okay I just wat to show you that what is the cofig files okay what is your ID ad how ca you use that what is your suppose this what is your cotaier ame what is that's my ame is ladig what is your uh storage accout ame these all are some cofig files we are creatig so oce you created your ml everythig you will create some dot py files some cofig file so that is the step oe you eed to do that is othig but your traiig operatios are ready why traiig operatios are ready the cliet is already said cliet is already said every moth he will get you will get a ew data you will get a ew data how ca you trai that you eed to create a automated pipelie right you could eed to create a automated pipelie that pipelie should do what data igestio should do the compoet oe compoet two compoet 3 compoet 4 compoet five these five compoets you eed to create a pipelie so that you ca cotiuously you ca cotiuously cotiuously trai the model trai the model o ew data so this is we ca say CET cotiuous traiig so that's why we eed to create this dot previous cofig files so you create you writte data igestio oe fuctio call data preparatio is aother fuctio call Eda is aother fuctio call model buildig is aother fuctio called evaluatio is aother fuctio call ow total five fuctio calls are called Phi compoets five compoets you created a pipelie you created a pipelie ad that pipelie what it will do every time a ew data will come it will do the same task it will do the same task data igestio data preparatio Ed every time it will do so this is the traiig operatios the code ad cofig we will do what it will do cotiuous traiig it will do after traiig operatios what it will happe cotiuous traiig by usig called traiig pipelie so oe traiig is doe you eed to deploy your model by usig call with register a model ad the we will do the oe the model deploy what is the usig you eed to serve right you eed to predictio whether I ca give the loa or ot whe I we ca I ca uh I ca group the customers or ot Productios by usig a servig package ad fially you eed to moitor that by usig all servig logs so these are the steps very simple you kow what is the first step model developmet ad secod step this is the hard math this is the heart of machie learig cotiuous traiig because ew data is comig I wat to do the cotiuous traiig after traiig is happeed I eed to do the model deploymet after deploymet is happeig I eed to do the serve the I eed to do the moitor I eed to do the moitor I'll give oe example here I'll give oe example here you will uderstad with that example ow suppose you wat to sed you wat to sed a courier a courier to your fried okay Courier or package career or package to your fried you lives i Hyderabad who lives i Hyderabad ad your fried lives i Delhi your fried your fried lives i lives i Delhi so uderstad this example is very very importat guys what you will do step oe what you will do tell me what you will do you will go to The Courier Service you will go to the Courier Service Courier Service ad register ad register a your ame register your ame ad Courier you will register this the step two so after register what you will do you will keep you will keep your package your package i The Courier office Courier office ad step three they will give they will give oe trackig ID they will give oe track ID trackig ID so that you ca track you ca track you ca track ow step four thik like that this you wat to sed you wat to sed aother package aother package i ext moth i ext moth so what will happe this is this moth is package umber oe ad ext moth is package umber two ad ext moth is package umber three some distiguish package umber oe packet umber two package umber three some distiguish will be there ow step five step five your fried should use ed user your fried use use that package fried use that package so these are these life cycle Ma these are the etire life cycle about the package thig ow this we will opt our ml Ops okay ready with dust ow importat steps eed to cosider mL of software model developmet your Courier you are goig to The Courier office ad you are register your package that meas you developed a model you wat to register your model that is called Model registry you register your package the you are keepig your package i The Courier office I register my model ext step is I wat to deploy my model deploymet is the ext step ow you said I wat to repeat this task that is the package umber oe package umber two package umber three ow o the ew data is a model created that is model umber oe i the ext moth it's the model umber two ad ext moth is the model umber three that is called modal versioig ad you wat to track your model that is the performace modal versioig is othig but model 1.0 Model 2.0 ad fially you wat to ed user what is your use case fially so this is a complete mL of steps guys model registry model deploymet model trackig model versioig model iferece so this is the complete mL of theory I hope you uderstood that mL of Siri okay model registry model deploymet model trackig model versioig I will tell you how ca we register the model that is the Practical we will see ow what happeed to shamai i oe miute guys yeah sorry guys yeah thak you ah ow you ad I hope you uderstood about ml Ops ad everythig ow what is the Practical sessio okay let's go to the Practical sessio ow but agai with that I'm repeatig agai what we have doe I'll just go to the my our slides previous slides the steps I eed to do machie learig cocept types of machie learig data sciece life cycle what is mL of why we use mL of ad mL of Cetral ad flow we have doe this ow with this I hope you uderstood about machie learig those who already kow they ca uderstad that I kow very well okay but there are two two types of guys right those who already do't kow about data sciece machie learig I hope you already kow about high level View ad those who already kow about motio learig you kow about how ml Ops is workig that is ow with this we will go for practical implemetatio so for this practical implemetatio I just wat to use here Google collab otebook Google collab otebook Okay Google collab otebook we wat to use that is why we use Google collab otebook why we use Google collab otebook so Google corrupt otebook is a free service pre-service is offerig the Google otebook Jupiter otebook kid of it is there are may two thigs guys oe is if it is a huge big data will be available if it is a huge big data will be available ow Google collab otebook is offerig from 25 GB data 25 GB data so that there is a huge data also you ca process also also it ca give oe GPU access ad TPU access oe GPU access ad TPU access ad secod oe is secod oe is ml Ops geerally is related to the cloud eviromet okay Geeral it is a cloud aime you wat to register a model right you wat to deploy a model that we will use the cloud so the cloud packages istallig Cloud packages istallig Cloud packages istallatio is tricky is tricky whe you i your local otebooks i your local Jupiter otebook so this is easy this is easy easy i Google collab otebook I like this actually because geerally we usually work o the cloud packages so whe we istall i the local Red it is ot at all istalled properly okay we eed to create a virtual eviromet s ad all this thig we eed to see so that's why it is easy i the Google collab otebook so we'll ope a Google collab otebook ow go to here just type Google collab just type Google collab ad the it is a ow it's a Google there's a ew otebook optio will be there click o the ew otebook click o the ew otebook ow here i the top you see right Utitled 3 13 so I just wat right here mL of workflow mL of workflow that is I'm give a ame here i the top okay reame The Notebook so to work o the Google collab otebook guys you eed to coect here the optio there is a coect is there you eed to iteret you eed to coect this that is the coectio it is a coectig so we'll take some i time because go to iteret issues or because of Iteret fast it will go to that iitializatio ad coect that ow secod step is you eed to coect ow it will give some Ram how much RAM it is 12.27 poit GB that is there ow I told you right we have oe GPU ad oe TPU is there go to rutime ow you have a chage rutime type ad there is a GPU is there ad TPU is there so the GPU is there ad TPU is there so if it is a big data you ca use that if it is ot big data do't use that that is ot a issue ad your file is there ad code optio is there text optio is there the beauty of Google collab otebook is it is ca work as a text Word documet you ca write some mathematics you ca write some images ad you ca do the code also that is the beauty of this okay so GPU ad TPU actually wheever you wat to use that right wheever the big data is at to speed up the process to speed up the process we have GPU ad we have TPU is there okay GPU ad TPU like suppose you have a big data is there you have a big data is there wheever you have a big data you eed to process very fast right wheever you wat to very fast you wat to process that we have local we have what CPU will be available locally we have CPU will be available well like four CPUs or three CPC level but GPU is a graphical Processig Uit geerally will speed up your process speed of your process to load suppose thik like that your data set your data set has oe 10 lakh observatio or 1 millio observatios 1 millio observatios to load 1 millio observatios how much time it will take i local how much time it will take local how much time will take i Google collab otebook that is the thig i collab otebook we have a GPU access ad we have a TPU access so that it we ca read very fast it ca read very fast it will be very slow so I ca say CPU is the lowest table GPU is highest level ad TPU is the very fast TPU is a very fast okay so if you wat the CPU this is the key iside GPU I ca use our ame TP is othig but tesor tesor processig uit GP is othig but graphical graphical processig uit ad uiverse if you write what is CPU cetral processig uit Cetral processig uit okay ow we are goig to here agai ow I wat to do my ml Ops here I just wat right here ml offs okay so my my I just write the otes also that is a beauty I like this Jupiter otebooks because you ca write the uh story also ot oly story like I ca do the image also okay I'm goig to here suppose MLS so I'm just takig oe image okay I just wat to show you this image which image I wat to take okay this image I will take ow go to the ispect ad there's a image okay the image is there right you are seeig that image go to the edit as HTML just copy this ad come to here go to the text ad Page this see image is comig ow that's the beauty you ca do the mathematics also like this you ca create the mathematics also okay ow step oe step oe step oe is ay ay ay pack ay code if you wat right you eed to istall a required packages istall required packages istall a required packages ow what is the packages we will use is we will use we wat to istall some packages so I will just display the packages ames here so here we will use a umpy package ad padas package ad sql package ad ml flow package okay umpy package used for what is a umerical pytho umerical pytho it is used for mathematics used for mathematics ad padas package user for data frame ad data aalysis sql package is used for machie learig algorithms machie learig algorithms ow ml flow is the ml flow is our ml operatios platform mlos platform MLS platform ow we'll see what is ml flow ow we'll just write here ml flow so ml flow is a platform for machie learig life cycle ow it is a ml Price look like this i the slow lae ow i the few miutes you will get to kow about what is this the latest versio is 2.2.2 it is a cloud package it is a cloud package we eed to istall this so this is default it will be there default default pytho it will be there o eed to istall ad here also this is padas also o eed to istall o eed to istall ad SQL ad also o eed to istall ml flow is the cloud package we eed to istall this okay ml flow is we eed to istall that first ml flow is there or ot there you just apply like this exclamatory Mark ml flow exclamatory Mark ml flow if you ru this if it is istalled you will get some to see somethig if it is ot istalled you will see commad ot foud okay you will see commad ot foud so that meas it is ot istalled so we will istall ow that is PIP istall ml flow simple if istall ml flow ow just istall this pip istall ml flow ow very good it is istalled so what it is istalled mac o databricks docker git database git pytho ad where is our ml flow here is ml flow you see right versus 2.2.2 ow the same thig we will ru here ml flow it is istalled ow so you will see somethig like this before what happeed if it is ot istalled you'll see commad ot foud after istallatio you ca see the some iformatio right this is good ow ext if you wat to see the versio also ow if you wat to see the versio ml flow versio so the latest versio is what 2.2.2 ow the same thig we have see here 2.2 it is released i 14th March oly so MLS is doe ow ext thig is import required packages I hope you clear the first poit right everyoe we istall a package i the step oe we istall a package i the step oe ow step two foreig what is that import required packages import required packages first package is import umpy as NP import ERS SP ow ow sql model ow I wat to give the iformatio here ow here I wat to use I wat to use a regressio model okay I wat to use a regressio model ame called elasticet the model ame is what elastic et model this is a model ame guys it is a regressio model you already kow what is the regressio model right regressio model is a supervised algorithm algorithm supervisor algorithm that meas we have iput will be there ad output will be there but output is output is i umerical data output is umerical data for this we ca use regressio algorithms that you already kow that is so what model I wat to use I wat to use a regressio model what is the ame of the model elasticet so ame of the model is elastic et data set I am takig is called wie quality data wie quality data what the data set ame is called wie quality data that meas I will tell you I will show the data set ad I will tell you what is your wie quality data ad platform we are usig Google collab otebook Google collab otebook ad the objective is here is objective what is your mai target is we eed to predict predict the quality of the quality of the wie so that is the data set ame is called wie quality data ad the model ame is called elastic et this is clear so ow from skl dot liear model dot liear model import elastic et will come automatically yeah elastic et that is doe ext from skl dot model selectio dot model selectio import trai test split I will tell you what is the tred test split I will tell you ext I wat to evaluate my model also right for that from skl dot matrix import these are some metrics these are some metrics mea absolute error mea squared error ad some R to score Do't Paic ow okay these are the some metrics those already kow about regressio aalysis they kow very well those who do't kow also do't eed to paic oce you lear you will easily uderstad oly thig is this will give your model performace okay if this will give your moral performace that's why we are sayig what metrics ad this is a skeleto is a package iside we have a liear model iside we have a elastic et agai sql is the package iside we have a model selectio ad we are importig trai test split I will tell you what is the strai test split ext oe is import ml flow ad we ca say import ml flow dot SK learig so these are my packages it is istalled ow step two is istall the packages is doe we are good at step two also right we are good at step two also yeah ow step three step three read the data read the data step three is read the data ow to read the data if you see here the file locatio is their files just click o this files ow you will see some Arrow will be there wheever you click o the files you will see some Arrow ow if you click o the Arrow I have some data sets will be there here I have wie quality red is there I am importig the data so ow the data is there why i quality red agai I'm repeatig guys we have some files locatio is there click o the files locatio click o the up Arrow it will redirect to your locatios okay ow iside we have oe data set will be there I uploaded that data ow I will read my data I will read my data ow data equal to PD dot read CSV PD dot read CSV I eed to provide the path iside I eed to provide the path there the three dots will be there here there are three dots will be there go to here there's a copy path will be available copy path ow copy that ad come to here ad ow apply data dot head it will give top five rows ow see this is my data it is my data fixed acidity volatile acidity citric acid these all are some chemical ames ow we have a Target is what called quality is our Target quality is our Target variable quality so these all are iput data sets ad this is our output colum it is a supervised learig ad it is a regressio problem it is a supervised supervised learig ad it is a regressio problem as simple as that ow just uderstad the data what are the colums are there o see first we'll uderstad how may rows ad how may colums are there that is give data dot shape so there are 149 ad rows are there ad 12 colums are there what it will give the iformatio this data set ad 12 colums are there 12 colums are there so i that 12 colums 11 colums are iput colums iput colum that is X ad oe colum that is what is the colum ame quality what is the colum ame quality ow quality is output colum output you ca say Target colum we geerally deoted by small y okay so we have 1 5 9 ad of course ad 12 colums i the 12 11 colums are iput colums ad oe colum is called is very good it is a regressio problem because we have quality is umerical data okay why it is a regressio problem quality is a target output colum output colum has umerical data umerical data so that's why it is called regressio yes very good umerical colum ow you got the poits very good that is excellet ow data dot shape ow that is completed ow you ca see data dot colums also i the quick way so our iterest is we are ot doig ay EDI here our iterest is to deploy model o the mloffs what is our iterest is our iterest is model developmet model developmet ad deploymet to develop a model to develop a model make sure we have all the colums all the colums have umerical data why umerical data mathematics math works oly o umbers oly o umbers so if ay categorical data is there we eed to covert ito umerical so first we will check where the umerical data is there or ot for that data.ifo will apply data.ifo ow it will see all our types of float float float o umerical ode categorical data all our umerical data we are put ad there's o ull values also see all our ormal it is a colum umber called fixed acidity umber is 159 error rows ad it is a o ull values ad data type is float 64. we are good you ca check this also data dot is ull dot sum if ay ull values is there for the correspodig colum wise it will give the sytax so we do't have ay ull values so we are good we do't have ull values ad we have the data is umerical way so we ca create our model developmet that is a step four ow step four step four just write like this model developmet usig ml flow ow here I wat to show you how the model developmet Geeral will happe okay so step oe is this is a very very importat step guys we eed to uderstad this is okay what I am tellig you is ow importat everyoe should uderstad first we divide we divide data ito two parts two parts oe is traied oe is traied data ad aother oe is test data okay we divide i two parts oe is traied data ad aother is test data ad secod is trai data as iput ad output tested data also as iput ad output agai we divide we divide traied data trai data ito iput data ad okay iput data ad output that meas iput colum separately output colums operatig so that we ca say exit trai ad wide trai simple we divided iput colum separately ad output colums separately ad the the same way we divide test data ito X test data ad Y test data first of all trai data data device data ad test data both havig iput colums ad output colums so we are separatig ito Excel trai y trai XO test ad Y test ad the model developmet model developmet happes o trai data o traied data model developmet will happe o trai data so ext step is model developmet will happe traied data the oce your model is created you eed to test right so I wat to model test so I wat to model predictios model predictios happes o X test data accept test data so this will give this will give y predictios very simple guys I have created my model the I wat to check my model is performed well or ot so I will pass X test ad model it will give some values that is we are callig y predictios fially fially I will compare I will compare my y predictios with Y test why predictios why predictios with Y test so this is the etire flow ow I just wat to show you maybe for write up you will cofuse but I will show you ow here how it will happe just see origial data iput colums are X1 X2 XP output colum is y we divide ito four parts trai data test data agai trai data is extra trai while trai X test y test what does that mea thik like that you have a data is like this you have a data is like this X is oe two three four Y is oe four ie sixtee twety five First Step Oe is divide ito two parts trai data test data the exitrai y trai X test y test ow come here this is the tred at first three observatios is the trai data last two observatios are the test data so it is a trai data extra trai white trai test data is a last observatio XO test y test ow my model is applied o which data trai data so I created a model called Y is equal to x square ow I will pass 4 to the Y is equal to x square I will get a predictio called 16.\",\n",
       " \"I will pass Y is equal to Phi to the x square I will got the prestified so my predictios are what 16 ad 25 ow I will compare the 1625 already existed 16 ad 25 so this is the compariso so this is geerally ml developmet flow will happe I hope this is clear right uderstadig this is very very importat guys so you geerally divide the data that's it you geerally divide the data ito two parts that's the trai data ad test data ad agai EXO trai ad Y trai so to do to do all these thigs to do all these thigs we have trai test split Eglish ame Commo Sese Eglish commo Eglish ame trai test split it is a SK L package what is this sql package so what I will do is I will divide I will divide my data ito 70 30 ratio 70 30 ratio that meas out of 5159 observatios of 70 percet of 70 percet is my trai data okay out of 1599 observatios 30 percet is my test data ow ad also I will divide trai ad test data radomly I will divide radomly that meas the idea how will be like oe two three four five like this oe ad so oe five ie  will be there so I will divide the trai data I will pick first fifth observatio I will pick 10th observatio I'll pick 500 observatio radomly I will pick okay y will pick radomly to avoid the bias to avoid the bias what is mea by bias suppose u r a you are a fa of Virat Kohli okay you are a fa of Virat Kohli I will call you I will ask you who is your favorite cricketer what you will say you'll say Virat Kohli oly suppose Sharma ad I will ask you who who is your fa Roy Sharma you will say so if I pick you the bias this is the bias if I pick the radomly this output might be differet this output might be differet this output might be differet so Cosolidated my model will give that good output so that's why Always divide the data radomly do't go with order okay oe oe two thousad is a traied data trai data ad oe zero zero oe two sixtee hudred is a test data this will give the bias do't go like this first thousad observatio pick radomly secod 1600 observatio agai pick radomly so this we will do what we will do divide data ito 70 30 ratio ad pick the observatios i the radomly ow we will do that okay how we'll do that here so trai is oe test is aother oe so I will apply trai test split trai test split iside I eed to pass my data ad I eed to pass my test size is equal to 0.3 what is this mea we are dividig data ito sevety thirty percet ow I will apply radom state radom State equal to you ca give ay umber oe two three four you ca give oe two you ca give aythig you ca give radomly it will pick okay ow trai dot shape ad test dot shape okay ow see out of 159 observatios oe oe ie observatio is your trai data 480 observatios are your test data ow if I go for trai dot head trai.head I will see radomly it is speakig first of the reaso is what 642 secod observatio 678 third four oe two fourth oe sevety three good right these are great actually we are dividig ito 70 30 ad we are applyig radom so if we got divided traied data ad test data ow we eed to divide X to trai ad ow ow divide data ito EXO trai trai X ad trai y iput colum output colum separately we already kow ow trai X equal to out of this all the colums if I remove this quality if I remove this quality remaiig colums are what trai data remaiig colums are traied data so trai dot drop I am droppig a colum quality quality I'm droppig so it is a colum so we eed to give X is equal to 1. so that's the trai data i the same way test data Test X so test data dot drop agai same quality comma X is equal to 1. so we divided iput data i the trai data we divide we got the iput data ad test also we got the iput data ow we get the output oe trai why so out of this strai data if I select oly quality colum if I select oly quality colum that is my output data that is my output data so trai dot ow you ca select oly the quality that's it ow test Y is equal to test quality ow that's it we're doe ow you ca check your trai x dot shape dot shape ad trai y dot shape out of 12 colums 11 colums are iput colum ad oe colum is what output colum right see total trade observatios are triple oe ie i that 11 colums are your trai X ad oly oe colum is what trai y i the same way we have Test X ad test y dot shape four AIT is eleve that the test data ad oe colum is output data so we divided Tred test split is that clear rate till ow if radom state is 0 istead of pickig 642 it will pick aother value okay if you give aother radom state it will give you so how ca you pass suppose I am givig oe dot here if oe dot okay how may lies how may lies ca pass through oe dot tell me what is your aswer how may lies you ca pass through oe dot Ifiity yes like that radom State you ca give ay value it ca pick ifiite times maybe after 642 it will come after four oe two will come after 73 will come 678 will come last so wheever you chage this value the goal is fixed it will pick the radomly but the umbers will be differet that's all ow we'll go to the our mai step ow step fifth ow start ml flow step fifth start ml flow start ml flow yeah ext ml flow is a cloud algorithm ml flow is what ml flow is a cloud platform is a cloud platform ow what I my what is my task I wat to develop a model I wat to develop a model ad I wat to deploy I wat to deploy o ML flow oe he eed to deploy a ml flow ext suppose Abhishek Abhishek is created aother model oe agai you eed to create a you eed to deploy ml flow okay ow this yeah radom state that is a radom state is othig but agai I told you right it is a radomly it will pick that well radomly it will pick that that is a radom state okay I hope I give your aswer already yeah oe two three four that oly if I give radom State equal to oe two three four ow tell me like this oe comma 2 comma three comma four comma five six seve eight ie te ow radomly it will stop with oe after that how may combiatios will come secod letter how may combiatios secod letter will come how may combiatios third letter will come how may combiatio fourth letter will come radomly may right so that may we will provide by usig called radom state radom state if you give radom State equal to oe it will give oe order two three four like oe oe oe oe oe oe oe oe oe oe like this so wheever you chage your radom State the umbers will be chaged here that's why I am explaiig okay yeah so ext so uderstad this is guys this start ml flow is very very importat ow omkar creates oe model you wat to deploy a ml flow object created oe model he wats to display a ml flow that meas what ml flow will do ml flow will create some workspace some workspace for you some workspace i the ame of i the ame of experimet what is the ame here ame of experimet remember this ml flow will create some workspace i the ame of experimet so first we eed to create our experimet what we'll do first to create our experimet so that is ml flow dot set experimet set experimet I'm givig some path my path is ml flow ml flow ad you are givig mL of ml Ops workspace MLS workspace so this is my ame this is my workspace ame you ca create your ow workspace okay you ca give ay ame also you ca give arratio M also here okay you ca give your ame also that meas you are settig a experimet why you are settig your experimet there are thousads of people who ca create their model ad they wat to deploy a ml flow ml flow should uderstad what is your experimet ame what is your workspace ame that ml flow should uderstad that that's why we are creatig a experimet ame ow this experimet is ot there so you see here experimet with ame ml flow mL of workspace does ot exist so we are creatig ad this is your experimet ID ad this is the life stages active ad artifact locatio I will tell you what is artifact locatio it will go to this locatio this is the locatio path okay we'll just prit some values we'll just prit some values so prit I'll just copy this dot experimet ID I'm just givig experimet ID ad agai I am prit this because I wat to use that ID I wat to use that ID so life cycle stage is active agai prit ad you ca give ame also so if I prit all these three ow first oe is my experimet ID ame this is my experimet ID so ow this is your ID ow your workspace is active what is your workspace ame ml flow mL of workspace I hope this you clear ow right ca I get aswer i the chat box this is uderstadig is importat ml flow set experimet yeah code ow experimet is ready ow we'll go to the code ow we'll go to the code ow so I will create some fuctio call because I wat to write multiple times so what I will do is I will create some fuctio call So Def trai model deftrai model is my fuctio called ame so first step is what developed develop trai test split I wat to divide my data that I already show you how to divide the data so we'll just copy from there because we already did that so what I will do is I will take this I'm takig this this is I have doe separated to make you uderstad guys okay this add-o separated to make you uderstad because uderstadig that is very very importat ow this is we have take so this is importat so I just remove this I do't wat this okay ow your trai model is doe ow ow secod is iitiate the ml flow ow iitiate iitiate ml flow ow so we are iitiatig ow with ml flow dot start ru let us start ru is there ml flow dot start ru iside it is askig some experimet ID you eed to provide your experimet ID what is your ru ame okay you ca give your ame also ad you ca give a descriptio also so I am providig my experimet ID experimet ID what is my experimet ID so this is my experimet ID right this is my experimet ID comma my ru ame I wat to provide ru ame also that is it is a regressio it is a regressio ad I will provide the descriptio also it is a descriptio also I wat to provide what is the descriptio here aythig aythig you ca write performig a regressio aalysis so this all we ca see UI ow ml flow UI we ca see this all so this is the fuctio call so we are puttig colos here ad we are ruig this okay experimet ID a ru ame ad descriptio ow Now call ml model ow call ml model what is your ml model ame ml model ame is called elasticet so I ca give LR equal to I am takig a variable ame called LR because liear regressio so elastic et elastic et so iside what are the parameters are comig Alpha is the oe parameter ad L1 ratio is aother parameter there are two parameters oe is Alpha ad aother is L1 ratio so I am givig Alpha Alpha is equal to some Alpha I am providig ad L1 ratio L1 ratio equal to L1 ratio I'm providig because these are my parameters I wat to chage these parameters every time I created a ew model okay mid it that I wat to chage these parameters I am creatig a ew model so L1 ratio why this is error is comig because these are the parameters we eed to give you the fuctio also Alpha comma L1 ratio ow this will goe ow elastic et is there ow fit ow develop your model model developmet o which data trai data so trai X comma trai y this is your model is developed so model creatio is happeed ow what we'll do model predictio ow model predictio model predictio will happe o which data X test data X test data model predictio will be happe so that is predicted data predicted data equal to LR dot predict because your model is which ame is there LR so LR dot predict which data you eed to pass Test X so this is model predictio ow be careful guys just uderstad this three steps first trai test plate ext call the model ext fit the model ext model predictio so ext what we will do model evaluatio model evaluatio ow model evaluatio what are your evaluatio techiques you have take rmse this three mea absolute error mai square error R2 Square so model evaluatio will compare o which data which data model evaluatio predictios versus test data predictio forces test data so that we will do evaluatio ow that we will do evaluatio so here rmsc equal to NP dot square root NP dot square root mea squared error mea squared error bracket you eed to compare with your test y with the predicted data simple ow RMS RMS root mea square error guys RMS is othig but what root mea square error I will tell you what is the root mea square error so first error equal to your actual value y actual value mius y predicted value okay suppose actual value is equals 16 is there your model is predicted as 17. how much your error is gettig mius 1 like that so this is error ow we eed to mea square error so first we eed to square this ad the we eed to apply mea is othig but summatio of may observatios first observatio first error error oe secod observatio error 2. third observatio error 3. so you eed to combie all the errors Error 1 Plus error 2 Place error 3 error 3 ad this we are squarig Square 1 square 2 square 3 we are applyig a mea so this is called mai square error the ame itself what mea square error if you apply the root that is called rmse so this is a metric okay I'm ot goig to about much deal much deeper i that because that is ot our iterest right I just wat to give you a quick glace what is rmse it is a root mai square error that is a rmsc ext mea e m a is othig but mea absolute error these are the metrics these are the Matrix mai absolute error so agai same y test sorry test y comma predicted data agai R2 Square R2 is equal to R2 score of test y comma predicted data so this is the full plasma so we are callig model modal predictio modal evaluatio till ow is that clear everyoe foreig we will do that I am ot comig to that way okay we'll do that model register we will do okay we are goig step by step good ow you eed to log these parameters what is the ext step is importat is I wat to track my I wat to track my modal parameters ad model metrics ad model ame so this is called we are registerig we wat to register our models we wat to register our metrics we wat to register our parameters so for that what we will do is we eed to go for here we eed to log that parameters you ca prit also while doig you ca prit also I'll just prit this okay prit prit Mia sorry comma Mae ad prit that R2 score comma R2 score so we are pritig ow ext importat is what log The Matrix log this Matrix parameters parameters ad model o ML flow o ML flow okay so ow ml flow DOT log uder the log we have artifacts is there Matrix is there param scissor okay so we are goig for log param so log param o which ame I wat to log this my ame is Alpha Alpha is my ame I wat to log Alpha agai same ml flow DOT log param what is I what is the param ow L1 ratio L1 ratio is my param that is called L1 ratio so parameters are completed ow ml flow ow Matrix ow there are three metrics are there ml flow ml flow DOT log metric DOT log metric okay what is the metric first oe RMS is my metric ame whatever you give here ame that will be visible guys if you give your your ame that will be visible okay so rmsc ad same thig I wat to just copy here two times but here is Mia [Music] ad here Mae ad the here R2 square that is equal to R2 ow this is doe ow I wat to log what I wat to log my model also ml for ML flow Dot skl so we have already sql is there right skl DOT log model what is that DOT log model what is your model ame your model ame is what LR what your model ame LR so my model ame is called LR comma the ame is called modal ow what is your register model I wat to register my model I wat to register my model so registered model ame is equal to elastic et my model ame is called elasticet oce you created your LR model that will be uder the model it will register we will see that ow how it will happe ow I'm just ruig this okay ow what are the two parameters takig Alpha ad L1 ratio we are callig this trai model okay ow we are callig this so I am givig here suppose 0.3 ad I'm givig here 0.2 ow I'm ruig this ow see rmsc is this Mei is this ow you see successfully model is registered with ame what elastic et ad what is the versio versio is oe these are importat to otice what your model ame is called elastic et what is the versio versio is oe ow wheever you ru i the left side there is a ml rus folder will be created okay i the left side ml rus folder will be created if you click o the ml rus if you click o the ml rus there is a your experimet ID will be there if you otice this is your experimet ID guys okay go to here check your experimet ID where is the experimet IDC so this experimetary five six five three two five six five three to your experimet ID ow here your models is there i the model there is a model m is what elastic et that you give right elastic et that model you give here elastic et what is the versio here oly oe versio oly oe versio is there ow if you click o the versio if you click o this method.aml you will see what is the timestamp what is updated what is the ame what is the Ru ID this is importat what is the Ru ID with this ru ID if you go to your experimets the same ru IDs will be there here see same ru ID ow if you go to the iside ru ID we have five thigs oe is artifacts Matrix params ad tags Matrix meas what you log rmse Mia R2 that Matrix will come to here what is the value 0.51 see 0.51 is your value what is R2 0.23 is your value what is rmse 0.66 your value this is a matrix ad what parets you give Alpha ad L1 ratio 0.3 ad 0.2 so this is the artifacts artifacts is othig but your model that pickle will be available so your model ow you ca had over to cliet bios called Model dot pickle ad to ru this etire setup what is your requiremet.txt I eed ml flow This Cloud pickle pathlib sql typig extesio so everythig will be available here guys okay everythig will be available here so agai I am repeatig so just see here just otice this so this is ot the fial thig we eed to show this i the ml flow UI that is our ultimate goal okay ow see here wheever you created your ml flow workspace they clearly say artifact locatio is cotet ml rus three two five three two so wheever you ru your code it will create a ml rus iside it will create a experimet ID ow iside you are you have ru oly oe time right that's why oe ruide is created suppose I have ru two secod time ow see see the beauty here suppose I give a value is called four argumet value is called five ow same ame that meas I am ruig secod time uderstood the same ame I am ruig secod time that mea ow versio 2 should create right ow I ru this ow euro ew ru ID Now ew versio is created versio two ow you go here you go here just refresh this go to your models elastic et is your ame oly oly oe ame uder oe ame how may versios is created ow two versios versio oe versio two what is your versio ID what is your versio ID is your versio ID ow go iside the experimet ow you ca see seve to be user oe more IDE ad all your metrics will be ow here params everythig will be here so this is how it will works ml flow ow our mai goal is we eed to show we eed to show this o ML flow UI first of all are you uderstad till ow this yeah yes correct exactly two metrics we ca use may metrics Nai okay why we are drop quality we are ot droppig we are droppig ad we are processig here you see here okay that is the overall story right I'm sayig while you are passig you are creatig your model we are ot droppig you are passig your trai X ad trai y why is your quality oly okay ml models packages pytho packages will create such that you eed to pass your iput ad output separately that's why we are droppig okay ow everythig we are loggig ot oly rmsc meae there are so may metrics will be available oce you lear about data sciece course you will get to kow that okay ext ow you uderstad ow what is our goal is ml flow UI ow thik like this ow I wat to go to the ml flow UI so this is your Google collab otebook okay this is your Google colum book this is your ml flow platform this is your ml flow UI whatever you doe ow you eed to trasfer here right to do this to do this we eed to create some tuel what you eed to create a tuel tuel you eed to create ormal Eglish ame create so to coect Google collab to ml flow UI we eed to create a tuel what we eed to create tuel so I will tell you what is the tuel ow so ow I will give all aswers ow at the ed ow okay because it should ot miss the flow ml flow UI to ru to create to create ml flow UI from Google collab otebook Google collab otebook we eed to create a tuel we eed to create a tuel ad that tuel ame is called the tuel ame is grok what is the ame is called grok Remember the Name  grok what is the ame  Grog what is grok grok is your tuel who is created this way the road okay the compay ame the compay ame is grok what the compay will do it will create a tuel from your local collab otebook to your UI that is called tuel ormal Eglish ame it is a road the road compay ame is called grok compay ame is what  grok ow we will pip istall pip istall ad grog first okay I eed to istall that grok ow  grok is istallig ad grock is istallig ow  gruck is istalled ow what we will do is we'll try to create a tuel create a tuel ow create a tuel we will create a tuel so pip istall from pi ad grok import grok okay pi ad grok I thik we eed to istall pi ad grock I thik ot oly utritioal Pie Grove because grok is ot workig owadays will work okay ad grog they are removig egrock actually they are callig that the pi ad Croc so pi ad grok ad grog so ext we eed to create a tuel tuel ad grow I will give a ame called grok tuel I will give you ad grog tuel equal to  grok dot coect it is a UI right wheever you wat to coect a UI we eed to give some address also that address geerally people will give 5000 report okay ad prototype also we eed to give that is http so this is I do't eed to explai because there is a UI UI should be i our server so that's why we are givig 5000 port i the http ow what we will do will prit will prit a trackig URI a trackig URI with the ame of trackig URI I wat to track my  Grog uderscore tuel Dot Public URI ayoe ca access public URL I'm just clickig this okay very simple guys we are tuel this is a compay compay ame is called grok we are coectig with address 5000.\",\n",
       " \"I'm just clickig this whe I clickig this what they are sayig traffic was successfully tuel to the grok aget but aget failed to establish ow we created a tuel successfully but this aget is ot givig permissio to create a UI why this is Aget is ot give permissio because you should ot provide a autheticated ID the aget does't kow the aget aget does't kow does't kow your ID your ID so

ow see there is o error it is askig visit site whe it is askig visit site this is we are we are success we're good so for that we eed to ru ml flow UI we eed to ru what ml flow UI we eed to ru so ml flow UI wheever you ru ad the you go to here withi the site whe you visit the site it will create a UI see how beautifully the UI is ow agai I'm repeatig guys oe we provided autheticatio toke we ru this it will cost the visit site oce it is doe you eed to ru your ml flow UI util you work o this this code is still ru oly ow we'll just familiar with ML flow UI what is your experimet ID tell me what is your experimet ID ame what is your workspace ame what your workspace ame guys ml offs uderscore somethig oe right see this is your workspace ml flow ml Ops workspace how may times you model do you ru two times you have ru oe is 16 miutes ago aother is 12 miutes ago what is your model ame oe is first oe versio 16 miutes ago you have ru that is the oe versio oe 12 miutes ago you have ru that is versio two ow if you click o place you have Matrix is there your parameters is there you ca compare those also ow first time whe I ru that is 0.511 ad secod time 0.547 first time whe I ru 0.662 secod time 0.694 this way is othig but model trackig modal performace model moitor okay we'll go step by step agai this is ml flow workspace iside how may times you create a ru your model two times what is your ru ame regressio is your our ru ame what is your Matrix we already logged all these metrics ow I'm just clickig o regressio ow this is your ru ID this is your ru ID ad model is registered here model is registered o 2023 0 4 16. what is the ame of the model elastic et what is the versio is a V1 ow your model is registered this is your model.pickle file this is your amml file ml file will give you what what is the depedecies what is the PIP fuctios ad everythig this is your ml model everythig so if you dowload this if you dowload this you ca had out to your cliet he ca ru ad he ca get the output that's be some simple that is okay ow parameters uder this ru ID what are the values uder this ru ID what are the metrics ad what are the work model everythig that is your models artifacts ad everythig ad they also give your predictio code also you ca directly call this oe ad you ca do this so we'll go step by step agai okay first step go to your workspace uderstad this UI how may times you have ru two times what is your ru ame regressio what is your model ame elastic et go to your models how may what is your model ame elasticet what is your latest versio versio 2 click o this how may times you have ru two times oe is versio oe aother is versio two so it is trackig versio also if you ru oe more thig it is versio three it is versio 3. ow do you feel which versio of model is good do you feel do you feel which versio of model is good support is sayig sir my versio oe model is good versio oe model is good suppose Abhishek is sayig my versio model is good my versio is model is good ow there's a two steps will be there guys oe is stagig ad aother oe is productio okay stagig is othig but what stagig is othig but it is a Alpha versio Alpha versio productio is othig but beta versio that meas stagig is othig but it is o our local systems it is iteral use iteral use that meas we are ot give to the cliet to that those models are i the productio level that cliet ca use okay i outside idustry we have two thigs are there oe stagig will be there aother oe is productio is there I am thikig I am thikig versio oe versio oe is a good model is a good model that ca go ito the productio level is sayig that sir my versio oe model is good I wat to set up ito the productio level so for that what we will use we will go to the versio oe the the stage will be there trasitio to stagig trasitio to productio or you do't wat to use this model go to Archive so versio oe is model is good I wat to use i the productio the I am puttig the productio level ow I'll go to my elastic et I am goig to my models ow my elastic et is my model ame what is my latest versio versio 2 is my latest versio but what is i the productio productio is the versio oe is there i the productio ow you thik versio 2 is i the stagig ow go to i the versio 2 put i the stagig eviromet ow people will thik like that this versio 2 is ow i the stagig level already versio 1 is sedig ito the productio level so cliet ca use the versio oe model but versio 2 is i the iteral use oly still developmet is goig o that is the meaig of stagig level this is a meaig of productio level ad you ca go to the experimets ad you ca get the versio to model also from your workspace this is a versio 2 model this is a ru ID this is a metrics everythig will be there so this is we are loggig we are register the model we are deploy the model we are trackig the model we are model versioig is happeig ad fially i ext few miutes we will iferece the model also we will see so this is the beauty of ml Ops guys s ow I will give pass you ca ask me if ay doubts thak you Abhishek you ca put i the chat because we almost completed this ad oly the iferecig is there I will show the iferece also ow if you wat ppds mL of a third party server provider exactly rajwal mL of you kow the beauty of this oe uh how it is oly three guys are rollig here okay oly three guys i the world oe is gcp oe is AWS oe is azure okay ow what we'll do I am workig with Acceture right so called Acceture or TCS or Ifosys we do't have ay Cloud setup right we do't have ay Cloud setup what we will do we will pay the moey to will pay the moey to either gcp Service as a AWS service or Azure service so they will offer this mlos platform or automl so called like this they will perform like this so ml Ops ow databricks is there that is also you ca use ml office tie up with so may compaies ml flow like that so every ew data we eed to work o the lower eviromet oce we test i the stage exactly exactly that is the correct but we eed to create some Pipelies okay you will ot create automatically you every time you should ot go you should ot create you will create some Pipelies how the pipelies will be there data igestio ad the data pre-processig pre-processig ad data Eda ow Eda is the very biggest star spread i the ideas there are so may drop tasks will be there feature selectio will be there feature egieerig will be there so may thigs will be there ad the we'll deploy a models ad the you log eter everythig yeah yeah that is the GitHub actios is importat ow you you I developed a suppose i my team ivitig five members are there okay five members are there I have worked I have worked o model developmet okay you are workig you are workig o Eda okay some other perso is workig o data igestio we all created dot py files oly dot py it's also dot py file oly this is also dot P Wi-Fi oly ow this all dot pofi ow I there's a GitHub is there ow you will push your code i the GitHub or GitHub or devops whatever it is you will push your record i the GitHub GitHub ad this guy also put your code i the GitHub there's a oe guy is there devops guy there's a oe guy is the devops guy what he will do he will Cosolidated our course Cosolidated our codes ad he will trigger the pipelie so that course ca be updated course ca be updated oce course ca be updated with ew code with a ew code your pipelie tree will trigger your ml flow will be triggered so that is called git actios that is also we will ed i our arratio so ew data ever go directly to the plot o ever produce productio level cliet should use cliet will ask may questios you kow you kow right how may cliet will ask the questios they ever uderstad aythig but we eed to explai to them everythig so ever go directly actual Adroid is what is happeig right so I am workig a compay called make SM okay ow make a si so we are developig some ml models to the vacatio we are developig some ml models ow the makers ad the data from the data they are gettig from PWC PWC that meas PWC is respodig for data they will give the medicie ow make a set equal to the Acceture ow data egieerig guys will do the data igestio ow data sciece will guide to the model developmet ow ml egieerig I will do the mL of both are same you are doig the same task owadays ow these guys always talk with PWC data ow this guy will say exted to the makasa how it is happeig ad everythig like that yeah yeah Rosha you ca cotact with admi we are we are startig that MLS batch so oce cliet everyoe certified share will push the product correct vekat you're absolutely correct our model do Ed automatically yeah we eed to create some Pipelies okay but this you eed to cotact with uh admi okay yeah we'll create a Pipelies so it is ot over those completed data sciece so we ca uh data sese it is good for two data sciece also if you kow the good go to data sese the you ca do that or you ca call to uht we will give a clear guidace o this actually we have oe more step is there guys okay wait for last miute okay we have oe more step is there what is our oe more step we reduce the predictios just copy this okay I'm just stoppig this ow okay ow this is my model this is my model which model versio 2 model I am loadig my model I wat to pass my test text the I will get my outputs these are my outputs if ay ew data will come they'll directly pass here ad they will get the output as simple as that because this is a free versio that's why we are stoppig ad we are ruig ad we are goig ad checkig there's a paid versios will be there actually if you pay that the you ca do automatically this that thig if this is a prepared versio is ot a paid versio that's why we are stoppig here whe you stop your ml flow will goe does UI will goe so that is a simple drawback here because we are usig a free versio right that's why so ow this is a ed to ed ml flow guys I hope you uderstood the everythig flow okay I hope that we have a very good sessio we have very good sessio you uderstad some extet some extet you uderstood how the life cycle how the data sciece life cycle will happe life cycle will happe so I'm expectig that you ca you ca say that i the chat also eed to Deep dive more yeah this is a simple task Workshop is ot like that Workshop is ot like that it is a simple like it is a first task so that i the goig o we ca do more tasks also that is but what we lear what is ml villai ad ext types of ml villai ad we lear data sciece lifecycle we lear ad we have see some good examples also why we eed ml Ops N2 ad ed to ed flow of mL of ad we lear about practical implemetatio practical implemetatio

icludes Theory as well as practicals ad this sessio is about two hours I'm expectig for two hours it might be good for 2.5 hours also because this is a very very importat topic we eed to coect with cloud ad we eed to Showcase that how it is works ad I will take all the questio ad aswers I will give some pass i Middle as well as at the ed so all q ad a sessio you ca take at  most probably you ca ote your questios I will give each ad every oe aswers okay ad first of all I eed oe cofirmatio how may of you kow about data sciece data sciece ad machie learig three parts oe preset four five yeah it's a good umber of people or kows that's very appreciate that but this sessio is etered from scratch level okay so I will go with scratch from do to uderstad high level flow that meas both Techical ad o-techical people ca uderstad I ca say that so this sessio is from scratch some scratch those who do't kow about machie learig do't kow about machie learig also they ca Now uderstad at least what is machie learig those who already kow about machie learig they kow about what is ml operatios how it is workig exactly so that is our ed goal so there are two face of cadidates I'm seeig here oe kows ML ad oe do't kow about ml but do't worry I will give from scratch level uderstadig you ca uderstad easily i the both levels so comig to the myself I am omkar alagoi um curretly workig as a seior data

evidece with the solid evidece with solid evidece I ca say solid evidece ad this evidece comes from some mathematical algorithms this evideces comes from mathematics mathematics algorithms so those those mathematical all algorithms mathematical algorithms we are sayig machie learig algorithm simple we are sayig ml algorithms very simple so machie learig is geerally it is the predict somethig by usig mathematics that's all ad that mathematics based o that we will develop so may ml algorithms like suppose I will give oe example okay provide me your compay employees attritio or the previous history suppose you have a compay called some Google compay is there take the example ow Google give me a data they're the previous employees history those who are every year those who are leavig the compay if you give me the data I will aalyze the patters I will aalyze the patters ad I will say i the ext couple of the years i the ext years how may people how may employees will stick with your compay how may employees stick with your compay stick with your compay we ca say that suppose you are a sales you are a dmod ower you are a dmart ower you wat to idetify your loyal customers loyal customers give me give me employees sorry give me customers customers trasactio data customer trasactio data I ca say who are your loyal customers who are your loyal customers I ca say that suppose you are a bak maager suppose you are a bak maager you wat to idetify whether a perso ca pay the loa or do't pay the loa you ca pay the loa or do't pay the loa do't pay the loa give me give me your M customers data previous data I ca say easily you ca pay the loa or do't pay the loa this is all our use cases these all our use cases that you ca predict the compay future by usig called machie learig what machie learig will geerally do it will aalyze the data aalyze the data ad patters it idetifies some patters Idetify some patters i the data patters i the data usig mathematics usig math so I will give a example everyoe kows a movie called super 30 right supercetig that's the famous Aad Kumar biography is a IIT traier i that there is a scee called Truth Rosha wet to a hotel okay he will say to the hotel guy your hotel will ot ru i ext two years will ot ru i ext two years he will say that if you remember that ad he will say your hotel will ot rai ext two years that hotel will shock how it is happe the come up with some calculatios okay so mathematics ad if the the hotel guy will believe so that is the power of mathematics if you people if you say the statemets people will ot people will ot covice coveyace with statemets people will covice with umbers should talk ot statemets that is the beauty of data ad Aalysis people will covice with them if I say Usai Bolt will 100 meters ru he ca do i the eight secods if I say that you will ot believe but if I show the statistics of Usai Bolt you ca defiitely believe so that is the power of mathematics ad those we are implemetig the machie learig algorithm but how this will happe how this will happe how this will happe how this will happe how the patters are happeig how the patters are happeig everythig how they are thikig ow everyoe talkig about AI ml deep learig they're talkig about that how these patters are happeig I will give oe example i our families we have a kids is there right small kids you wat to trai your kid trai your kid with some iformatio some iformatio trai your kid with some iformatio what is the iformatio example oe okay example oe you are watchig a TV you are watchig a TV okay ow you say you say to your kid your kid this is a TV this is your TV ow because the kid is a huma beig huma he ca uderstad he ca uderstad what you say ad he will uderstad some patters you will uderstad some patters what is the patters first patter it is a rectagular box it is a rectagular box secod patter some color colors are there obviously i the TV some show is ruig colors will be there right some colors are there ad third poit some cartoo people also there you'll uderstad the cartoos you do't kow about Shahrukh Kha you do't kow what Salma Kha is comig i the TV right he will simply uderstad the cartoos so these patters he ca uderstad that meas he uderstads the patters he's ot a system his erve system is uderstadig the patters that is we are talkig about euros owadays i the Deep learig ow secod example ow secod example you wet to the theater you wet to the theater or Mall to watch a movie to watch a movie ow ask a questio to your kid ow ask a questio to your kid ask a questio your kid what is this what is this ow based o his patters what is his patters his rectagular box theater screeigs rectagular box yes some colors are goig yes some cartoos are goig yes the what is you'll say aswer he will say mama this is a TV ow you will say o it is wrog it is wrog it is ot a TV it is a theater the he will uderstad he will add the fourth patter okay it's a big scree some big rectagular scree is there big rectagular scree is there so that he will uderstad okay if it is a small rectagular box is there it is a TV if it is a big rectagular box is there it is a theater ow ask the third example ow watch movie i laptop watch movie i laptop ad ask the questio what is this ow he already kow about the small thig is Stevia ad big thig is rectagular that is a theater he will either because he is a huma beig he ca uderstad the patter he will either say he either say TV or say theater because he kows he is a huma beig the same thig how you are traied the iformatio how you are traied the iformatio how this guy is uderstadig the patters if that iformatio you are testig with ew data textig with ew data ow you are uderstadig whether he ca say right aswer or wrog aswer if it is say right you are happy your model is good if it is wrog agai you are tradig with ew data so that's where that's where the machie learig will applicable actually so that's what is patters how our huma beig i midset we are discussig about patters i the same way the mathematics also will discuss the patters the mathematics will geerate the patters ow if you see here we are sedig a traied data we are creatig some ml algorithm the model is created ow i the same way you are providig you are a TV you are providig a theater ow you are askig a questio what is this he might be predicted somethig so that predictio you will do evaluate whether he say good okay if you say wrog agai you eed to trai with the dose data so that way machie learig all Gardes will works I hope those who are do't kow about machie learig ow we ca some extet he ca kow about the what is machie learig right ca I say yes or o i the chart you ca give me replay i the chat also I ca pass oe miute yeah thak you so ext ext we have some types of learigs will be happeed because there are so much data is there right ad the data is a huge data will be there so that's why what they are doig machie learig people they are dividig some types i that oe type is called supervisor learig supervisor learig ad aother type is called usupervised learig oe more type is called reiforcemet learig it is very easy guys supervisor learig meas suppose you have a use cases there i the use case you have some iput data is there ad output data is there so what is iput data ad what is output data ow comig to this Bak data suppose suppose you go here so this is a bak data some loa ID is there some geder is there educatio is there self-employed applicat icome loa amout loa amout term is there ad loa status so what is the objective of this data you eed to idetify the customer whether we ca grat a loa him or ot that is objective the objective is so for this loa IDK 1002 what is the status yes you are grated a loa you are ot grated a loa okay so these kid of data if you see that meas this loa ID geder educatio employed these are we ca say iput colums what we ca say iput colums ad what you are seeig loa status we ca say this is output colum because you wat to predict somethig so tomorrow I am goig with my ID I am a male cadidate I am a graduate I am ot a self-employed ad the my applicat icome is there so whether he ca provide the loa or ot that meas i the data you have some iput data will be there ad output that I will be there if you see that kid of thig we ca say this is a supervisor learig we ca say so I have see some participats raise their hads but I will pass i Middle you ca ask your questio i the chat at the time I will defiitely aswer okay ow ext uder the shoe I kow we got what is supervised learig here so I'll just give a example here Super Wise to the learig supervised learig meas we have some iput data will be there iput data will be there ad correspodig we have output database also will be available output data but agai i the iput data ad output you have a supervised learig i that supervisor learig agai we have oe more techique is called classificatio classificatio techique ad secod oe is we ca say regressio techique classificatio regressio what is the geeral Eglish meaig of classificatio guys what the geeral meaig of Eglish class meaig classificatio you are classified somethig classified somethig okay you are you are classificatio somethig like s or o some zoes like support covet Joes owadays Kobe Joes what is that gree zoe gree zoe orage Zoe Red Zoe some classificatio some parts are fail pass or fail these are the classificatio so here i the data here loa status is y is there ad loa status is o is there s is there o is there it is a classificatio so first questio is do we have output data yes do we have output data if thus output data is a categorical or ot ow ext questio is if that output data output data is i the form of categorical categorical some Eglish ames categorical the it is called classificatio techique simple so ow I will a questio this is a supervisor learig or ot this data is a supervised learig or ot yes it is a supervised learig how ca we are sayig it has iput data is there ad it has output data also there so it is a supervised learig ext questio it is a classificatio problem or regressio problem ow check the output if output is a categorical data of umerical data output is a categorical data so it is a classificatio problem ow oe more example I will take ow here my objective is predict the total umber of sales based o the advertisemet cost o differet medium I have a ower of some so so I am a ower of D Mart okay I wat to icrease my sales so what I decided I wat to sped some moey o some advertisemet advertisig so I sped some moey o TV ad ewspaper ad social media I wat to predict my sales if I sped this much what is my sales 2000 if I sped this much what is my sales it is a 1950 so first of all do you idetify the iput here what is your iput colums here TV ewspaper social media what is your output colum sales ow tell me it is a supervised learig or ot yes it is a supervised learig but if this your output is a umerical data or categorical data it is a umerical data ow output is output is a umerical data umerical data so if it is a umerical data the that model we called regressio model what is the model called regressio model so that is the supervised learig that is the first oe ad ext oe if you see here ext oe is called usupervised learig usupervised learig so usupervised learig is very simple guys supervised learig we are seeig some output data is there i the usupervised learig we do't have output data very simple we do't have output data what is the example for that ow see here the example for this this is called the objective is segmet or group the customers based o the aual icome ad spedig source ow you are a d Mart ower ow you have some customer IDC is there their age is there their geder is there ad the aual icome also there ad the spedig scores every moth the customers are comig to your market ad they are spedig somethig moey ad you are givig some spedig score based o the spedig score you wat to idetify whether they are a rich customers or poor customers they are importat customers are ot importat customers you wat to group them so here there is o output data your our use case is I wat to segmet the people I wat to divide the people how may people are my rich customers how may people are my poor customers I wat to divide those groups so that's why it is called it is a usupervised learig so that is the thig ad what you are seeig is called some algorithms like I said machie learig is developed by mathematics so that mathematics we are callig ml algorithms so agai machie learig is to divide it to three parts supervised ad usupervised so uder supervise you have some classificatio problem is there ad you have regressio problem is safe so classificatio meas you have a output data that is the step oe ad ext that output data is categorical the go for these may algorithms decisio trees Navi bias svm do't worry about these algorithms okay but just uderstad the high level View uderstad the high level view first of all machie learig is mathematics simple I will give you a fuy example I'll see you at this you have a data is there whe X is equal to 1 Y is equal to oe X is equal to Y is equal to 4 X is equal 3 Y is equal to 9 x equal to 4 Y is equal to 16 whe I say x is equal to 20 what Y is equal to tell me what is the Y is equal to put i you are aswerig the chart I just wat to see your yeah very good 400. how did you say this 400 how did you say this 400 because i your mid you created some mathematics equatio that is called Y is equal to x square this is ml algorithm guys this is a simple ml algorithm based o the previous data based o the previous data you predicted oe ml algorithm the you are sedig this x is equal to 20 to this algorithm it is givig Y is equal to 400 simple that's it ow thik about imagie as a big data is there for the Big Data you eed some calculus ad algebra mathematics we will develop some mathematical equatio like this so those mathematical algorithms we have give some ames that's all but mathematics is very simple mathematics that we are usig that is algebra algebra ad calculus all geographical so oly simple mathematics we are ot doig ay itegratio or differetiatio that we are ot usig here simple algebra ad calculus we will develop some ml models I hope people should uderstad ow what is exactly ml model meas this is your history data you created a ml model ow so ow people already created some more ml models by usig some mathematics we are usig that ow these are the some usupervised learig algorithms ad supervised learig algorithms do't worry about algorithms agai I am sayig that algorithms is othig but some mathematics simple algorithms is othig but a mathematics ow comig to the reiforcemet learig reiformig is geerally aget agets should respod with our actios like iPhoe Siri okay iPhoe series is a hey Siri what is the time ow if you say us it will give us some time right so that is a reiforcemet learig so ow robotic self-drivig cars Alexa these are the reiforcemet learig Earth Gardes so that's why we call so so I called AI owadays yeah ow if you see i 2019 I thik i 2019 our ISRO uh do for magala 2. okay that is for the moo they actually should lad at some place but due to the evirometal coditio it is ladig some other place that's why it is failed here whe it is ladig it is ot able to Ladig successfully because the evirometal coditios is ot able to respod that aget so they implemeted the AI coditio i the ISRO eviromet but obviously the moo coditios is differet there's a rocket sciece it's ot a easy task so that's why we got some failure but is 95 success that is so like that way the reiforcemet learig owadays the so much moey they are spedig o this reiforcemet learig so this is about the machie learig ad the types guys so I will give oe pass here okay I will give oe pass ad all the cluster algorithms are usupervised algorithms yes you are correct all cluster algorithms are called usupervised learig clusterig othig but groupig or segmetatio your characterizatio if you have ay doubts you ca ask me I will give oe miute we do't kow cluster what is oe me we do't kow cluster how to pursue this course yeah this is a data sciece course that will be talk about maagemet okay yeah yes that is aother city that is our mai evet we'll talk about this all these thigs but at least you ca idetify the high level view right what is machie learig what is data sciece everythig yeah the you ca easily lear about cluster algorithms that is that you ca say ext what is the reiforcemet Ledig yeah course cotet I will that admi will take care of okay that is ot our Workshop thig okay ow okay we'll go to the ext thig that admi will take that first you uderstad the cocept ed to ed flow agai at the ed we will discuss about your doubts okay but i the middle I wat to kow the specific questios that is related to your Cocepts ow some people are algorithm reiforcemet learig algorithm they are askig so reiforce rederig algorithms is completely a algorithms okay that is you ca kow huggig phase Trasformers there's a example that is we ca say huggig phase Trasformers or robotics or Trasformers are there there is a call huggig face Trasformers okay huggig face huggig face or you ca say YOLO there's a YOLO algorithm is there you look oly oce okay you look oly oce you ca test type YOLO you will idetify image objects for self-drivig cars or movig objects they will idetify like this there are some algorithms so ext this is a very very importat guys what is a data sciece life cycle what is a data sese life cycle so of course I told you agai I leared mathematics Islad everythig I wat to implemet the programmig laguage I eed required is pytho okay those who are learig about pytho it is a very good course agai I am sayig that why this is pytho is a tool pytho is a tool pytho is a tool but data sciece is a subject it is a subject okay cyber security cyber security is a subject okay iot is a subject I what is a subject like that ad cloud computig cloud computig is a subject okay cloud computig subject those who are learig the tools my best advice is lear ay oe of the subjects so that you ca master that subject ad there's a so much lifespa i the IIT carrier okay pytho is a tool those who are learig pytho the best choice is data sciece that is ed to ed you ca kow that so ext so data sciece life cycle guys this is the data so ay data sciece lifecycle ot all ay data sciece lifecycle guys suppose you I am a you are a data scietist I am a customer I am some HDFC Bak okay I'm HDFC Bak customer I wat to kow that my customer home loa capacity so first ad most importat is what you eed to uderstad about busiess problem okay first of all what is your problem is the HDFC bak is comig to you ad they will have some help for you the first what is that you eed to uderstad about busiess problem what is your problem oce you uderstad the problem oce you uderstad the problem you eed to collect the data the HDFC bak will provide data to you hfc bak will provide the data to you ext this data might be a structured data or ustructured data data might be a structured data or ustructured data so this data might be a structured way or ustructured way okay ow what you will do you will make a data preparatio you make the data ito structured way or you are puttig ito some database ad ready to use some database you will make ito some database you are load all this data to the i this database ad the data is ready oce data is ready this is the heart of data sciece guys we call Eda exploratory data aalysis exploratory data aalysis what you will do i the data aalysis you will uderstad some isights uderstad some isight what is the iside what is the mea value what is the media value what is the mode what is the variace how it is goig the all statistical Cocepts what is the populatio how the sample is workig ad what is the hypothesis this is all a statistical Cocepts if you remember your childhood days we kow our statistics right so based o the statistics you eed to idetify based o statistics we eed to idetify Idetify some patters Idetify some patters we eed to idetify that so that's why EDI is a very very importat ad the oce EDI is doe we will develop our ml models so called mathematics models ml models you you said sir I created a model okay you said home cursor I created a model but how ca I kow your model is good or ot how ca you kow your Y is equal to x square is a good correct model or ot you developed a y is equal to x square ad you said Assad this is my model verify this how ca I verify by usig model evaluatio whether your model is correct or wrog I eed to do the modal evaluatio the fially your model is ready ad I eed to deploy your model deploymets what this HDFC bak I should use right you created your model here but HDFC bak I should use that is a model deploymet so this is a data sciece lifecycle guys you eed to uderstad the busiess problem data collectio data preparatio the step by step o eed to buy heart also this is this is commo sese I eed to uderstad the problem ext I eed to thik about solutio for to thik about solutio I eed some resources here resources is the data sciece I have data is there I eed to prepare the data i the orgaized way I data is prepared I eed to do some statistical aalysis because my duty is that data sciece duty is oly to uderstad the patters ow I eed to create a model my model is doe ow I wat to verify this model is good or ot that's the evaluatio the I eed to deploy the model because HDFC bak I should use ow data sciece is completed with this ow you created a model ow you created a model thik like this you created created a model I will take Y is equal to x square oly because that you created from your mid just ow okay I'm just kiddig but why is equal to sphere your model you created that model Y is called x square ow HDFC Bak should use that model HDFC Bak should use that model okay this Y is equal to x square you created a model by usig pytho code by usig pytho code is created by usig pytho code ow pytho code you ru i your local pytho code you ru i your local ow how ca HDFC guy use that how ca HDFC I use your model that is the questio umber oe questio umber oe how ca a cliet we ca call cliet use your model so this we are i IT idustry the term called productio okay what would be the term is called productio how ca a cliet use your model i the productio level how ca a cliet use your model i the productio level ad secod questio the cliet is sayig cliet is sayig that sayig that every moth every moth I will geerate geerate a ew data ew data how ca your model respod how ca your model respod o the ew data ad I should write my questio first you created Y is equal to x square ow how ca you had over to the cliet the productio level ext cliet is sayig that every moth I will geerate a ew data how ca your model is respod ow ext third questio is how ca you moitor you ca say moitor or track your model performace modal performace tell me these three questios that's it I'm good so this is your local everythig is your local but how ca you aswer this all questios so that's where we comig mlogs machie learig operatios ow see here after model developmet after model developmet we eed to ask some questios ourselves first questio is how ca we had over a developed model to cliet which meas how ca we deploy our model o productio level that is the first questio valid questio right this is a very valid questio because your model is developed i a local system i my computer I developed but how ca I had over to the cliet it's a valid questio ow how ca we trai our model agai o the fresh data ow oe like customers are comig i this moth April ad two lakh customers are comig i the Jue ow your model you your pytho code should be geeralized code right that code should trai o the ew data so that is the ext questio how ca we trai our model o fresh data i future o productio level ow third questio how ca we moitor or track our model performace ow this moth April moth oe lakh customers are there I created a model Y is equal to x square is my model my model performace is good I am gettig accuracy is equal 90 percet ow after Jue 2 lakhs customers are comig ow if your model is traiig o the fresh data Maybe your model is performace will drop 70 percet will come how ca you moitor or track the model performace so these are the all valid questios i the Cloud eviromet whe we are trasferrig ito the cliet productio level so there oe more thig is called how ca we maitai the ed-to-ed flow from data igestio to predictio like I told you right data is there ijectio ad you eed to do predictio so from here to Here There Is the Ed to Ed flow is there how ca you maitai this ed-to-ed flow for cliet so where to aswer all about questios our best practice is ml Ops ow see the sceario i the two ways guys oe is developig a model is oe way ad productio as the model is aother way productio level okay developed a model is a data sciece people will do so to do the Productios ml egieerig I will do ml egieerig very simple ml egieerig so I will say I will tell you a beautiful thig ow i the AI world of AI rules i the world of Errors there are three kigs are there first oe is the data egieer guy what data egieer guy will do cliet will come HDFC bak will put some data ito somewhere okay ow the data egieer respod is you eed to igest the data to make use of the data sciece okay that is the data egieer guy so I'm a data egieer my respose is what HDFC bak is givig a data to me I wats to put the data ito i the Some Cloud eviromet some database or SQL Microsoft SQL Server so that data sciece guy ca use the data that is a data egieer guy so this is a base level oe ow data is ready i the cloud data is ready i the database data is ready i the database okay the data sciece will come so what this value guy do you will uderstad the patters ad you will created a ml models it will create a ml models these are data sciece guy o third there is a ml egieer what this guy's respose is he will make use of this ml model to the cliet i the productio level cliets should use productio level so these are all importat people i the world of AI without these guys data egieer data scietist ad we ca say ml egieer so these three guys are very very importat so some maybe the model developmet does't kow about this guy okay the model developmet does't kow about this guy this guy kows model developmet this guy kow how to make ito productio okay but as a good idea guy we eed to kow about how the data sciece algorithms will work ad how the ml egieer should work ow yeah I hope you uderstood right the rules how the roles are distiguished data egieer will igest the data data scietists will do develop the model ml egieer will do productioize the model so this is the rules of i the three people so you ca say ml Ops is a level three level three so I will just show you here for you make you easy I will just write here step oe igest the data step two develop ml models step 3 make use the ml models i the productio eviromet the productio eviromet so this guy is a data egieer guy this guy is a data sciece guy ad this guy is a ml egieer guy MLG so where our ml Ops will come to here everyoe else will come to here so data egieer guys Place data sciece guys will closely work each other closely work each other ow data sciece guys plus ml egieerig guys will closely work to each other closely work each other but they were igestig a data idustry data is a very hectic task okay there are so may people will requiremet here much people eeded here much people eeded here i the same way MLG Egieerig also much people required here because puttig i the productio level is ot a easy task okay so that's why I always remember data sciece ad MLG is the part this both combiatio if you kow about data sese ad MLG the you will lead the idustry you ca lead IIT easily data sciece ad MLD o I kow I hope you have some broad picture ow but I just wat to repeat agai I just wat repeat agai so we have started with our machie learig what is about machie learig ad we kow about types of machie learig ad we kow about data sese life cycle ad after model developmet what is the questios you eed to ask yourself ad the for to all these questios to aswer we go for MLS okay ow good high up till ow you uderstad right everythig the high level flow ca I expect yes yeah to uderstood the high level flow yeah the questios I will take I will aswer all the questios do't worry guys because this sessio is for you oly okay this sectio is especially we are set up for you oly to clear all your high level doubts clarificatios we'll take olie offlie also both yeah we'll talk that at the ed okay ow see ml Ops is the full form is called machie learig operatios that is clear what is mL of score fuctio is machie learig is focused o machie learig models through the productio that oly I am tellig right machie learig models to the productio ad the you eed to maitai ad you eed to moitor very simple guys you eed to put that i the productio ad moitor so mL of is a collaborative fuctio of a data scietist guys ad devops guys it's a combiatio thak God I am workig some mL of project so eve though I'm a data scietist so that I kow about ed to ed flow so I very much thak to God because I have your opportuity to work with ML Ops also because I do't wat stick as a guy with oly I kow models I kow the iterest I wat to kow about ed to ed flow you should be ethusiasm like that so that's why we are here to teach you ow why we eed mlos ow you already have a aswer why you eed MLS because machie learig life cycle is a very complex life cycle you eed to igest the data you eed to apply Eda you eed to do feature egieerig you eed to do the model traiig you eed to about model performace you eed to the predictios you eed to deploymet moitorig ad you eed to do the automated model traiig that is there's so may life cycles are there but these life cycles are trust me guys you ca ejoy this you ca ejoy literally if you kow about this data sciece ad ml Ops you will ejoy the life you ca you oly do the so much work because these all are r d this is all our r d it is ot like a daily routie toss it's ot agai like a rotat us it is like a complete R ad a research ad developmet we are i that so you kow about why we eed mlos ow this where is a very very importat thig guys mL of ed-to-ed workflow first two step is what ml developmet ext ml developmet you eed to create a traiig operatios what is the traiig operatios I will tell you so i ml developmet after ml developmet that meas I ca say ml developmet here step oe ml developmet is there what is ml developmet you will do you will do data igestio you will do okay data igestio you do you will do data preparatio you will do ow you should't you should say the steps ow okay you do data preparatio you will do Eda ad you will do model buildig model buildig ad you will do evaluatio this is all your steps you do data igestio data preparatio Ada model buildig evaluatio we will do that's clear this everythig you will make oe setup guys you will make create a DOT py file dot py file ad some cofig file some cofig file you will create some dot py file some cofig file what is cofig file I hope I ca show you that give me oe miute give me oe miute guys I ca show you the some cofig file so this is a cofig file you see this is the cofig file I have created what is the Q a maker Commuity Services what is the storage Services what is auto complete Services I'm creatig some ames so that I ca use my pytho code okay do't do't worry about Do't Paic about that okay I just wat to show you that what is the cofig files okay what is your ID ad how ca you use that what is your suppose this what is your cotaier ame what is that's my ame is ladig what is your uh storage accout ame these all are some cofig files we are creatig so oce you created your ml everythig you will create some dot py files some cofig file so that is the step oe you eed to do that is othig but your traiig operatios are ready why traiig operatios are ready the cliet is already said cliet is already said every moth he will get you will get a ew data you will get a ew data how ca you trai that you eed to create a automated pipelie right you could eed to create a automated pipelie that pipelie should do what data igestio should do the compoet oe compoet two compoet 3 compoet 4 compoet five these five compoets you eed to create a pipelie so that you ca cotiuously you ca cotiuously cotiuously trai the model trai the model o ew data so this is we ca say CET cotiuous traiig so that's why we eed to create this dot previous cofig files so you create you writte data igestio oe fuctio call data preparatio is aother fuctio call Eda is aother fuctio call model buildig is aother fuctio called evaluatio is aother fuctio call ow total five fuctio calls are called Phi compoets five compoets you created a pipelie you created a pipelie ad that pipelie what it will do every time a ew data will come it will do the same task it will do the same task data igestio data preparatio Ed every time it will do so this is the traiig operatios the code ad cofig we will do what it will do cotiuous traiig it will do after traiig operatios what it will happe cotiuous traiig by usig called traiig pipelie so oe traiig is doe you eed to deploy your model by usig call with register a model ad the we will do the oe the model deploy what is the usig you eed to serve right you eed to predictio whether I ca give the loa or ot whe I we ca I ca uh I ca group the customers or ot Productios by usig a servig package ad fially you eed to moitor that by usig all servig logs so these are the steps very simple you kow what is the first step model developmet ad secod step this is the hard math this is the heart of machie learig cotiuous traiig because ew data is comig I wat to do the cotiuous traiig after traiig is happeed I eed to do the model deploymet after deploymet is happeig I eed to do the serve the I eed to do the moitor I eed to do the moitor I'll give oe example here I'll give oe example here you will uderstad with that example ow suppose you wat to sed you wat to sed a courier a courier to your fried okay Courier or package career or package to your fried you lives i Hyderabad who lives i Hyderabad ad your fried lives i Delhi your fried your fried lives i lives i Delhi so uderstad this example is very very importat guys what you will do step oe what you will do tell me what you will do you will go to The Courier Service you will go to the Courier Service Courier Service ad register ad register a your ame register your ame ad Courier you will register this the step two so after register what you will do you will keep you will keep your package your package i The Courier office Courier office ad step three they will give they will give oe trackig ID they will give oe track ID trackig ID so that you ca track you ca track you ca track ow step four thik like that this you wat to sed you wat to sed aother package aother package i ext moth i ext moth so what will happe this is this moth is package umber oe ad ext moth is package umber two ad ext moth is package umber three some distiguish package umber oe packet umber two package umber three some distiguish will be there ow step five step five your fried should use ed user your fried use use that package fried use that package so these are these life cycle Ma these are the etire life cycle about the package thig ow this we will opt our ml Ops okay ready with dust ow importat steps eed to cosider mL of software model developmet your Courier you are goig to The Courier office ad you are register your package that meas you developed a model you wat to register your model that is called Model registry you register your package the you are keepig your package i The Courier office I register my model ext step is I wat to deploy my model deploymet is the ext step ow you said I wat to repeat this task that is the package umber oe package umber two package umber three ow o the ew data is a model created that is model umber oe i the ext moth it's the model umber two ad ext moth is the model umber three that is called modal versioig ad you wat to track your model that is the performace modal versioig is othig but model 1.0 Model 2.0 ad fially you wat to ed user what is your use case fially so this is a complete mL of steps guys model registry model deploymet model trackig model versioig model iferece so this is the complete mL of theory I hope you uderstood that mL of Siri okay model registry model deploymet model trackig model versioig I will tell you how ca we register the model that is the Practical we will see ow what happeed to shamai i oe miute guys yeah sorry guys yeah thak you ah ow you ad I hope you uderstood about ml Ops ad everythig ow what is the Practical sessio okay let's go to the Practical sessio ow but agai with that I'm repeatig agai what we have doe I'll just go to the my our slides previous slides the steps I eed to do machie learig cocept types of machie learig data sciece life cycle what is mL of why we use mL of ad mL of Cetral ad flow we have doe this ow with this I hope you uderstood about machie learig those who already kow they ca uderstad that I kow very well okay but there are two two types of guys right those who already do't kow about data sciece machie learig I hope you already kow about high level View ad those who already kow about motio learig you kow about how ml Ops is workig that is ow with this we will go for practical implemetatio so for this practical implemetatio I just wat to use here Google collab otebook Google collab otebook Okay Google collab otebook we wat to use that is why we use Google collab otebook why we use Google collab otebook so Google corrupt otebook is a free service pre-service is offerig the Google otebook Jupiter otebook kid of it is there are may two thigs guys oe is if it is a huge big data will be available if it is a huge big data will be available ow Google collab otebook is offerig from 25 GB data 25 GB data so that there is a huge data also you ca process also also it ca give oe GPU access ad TPU access oe GPU access ad TPU access ad secod oe is secod oe is ml Ops geerally is related to the cloud eviromet okay Geeral it is a cloud aime you wat to register a model right you wat to deploy a model that we will use the cloud so the cloud packages istallig Cloud packages istallig Cloud packages istallatio is tricky is tricky whe you i your local otebooks i your local Jupiter otebook so this is easy this is easy easy i Google collab otebook I like this actually because geerally we usually work o the cloud packages so whe we istall i the local Red it is ot at all istalled properly okay we eed to create a virtual eviromet s ad all this thig we eed to see so that's why it is easy i the Google collab otebook so we'll ope a Google collab otebook ow go to here just type Google collab just type Google collab ad the it is a ow it's a Google there's a ew otebook optio will be there click o the ew otebook click o the ew otebook ow here i the top you see right Utitled 3 13 so I just wat right here mL of workflow mL of workflow that is I'm give a ame here i the top okay reame The Notebook so to work o the Google collab otebook guys you eed to coect here the optio there is a coect is there you eed to iteret you eed to coect this that is the coectio it is a coectig so we'll take some i time because go to iteret issues or because of Iteret fast it will go to that iitializatio ad coect that ow secod step is you eed to coect ow it will give some Ram how much RAM it is 12.27 poit GB that is there ow I told you right we have oe GPU ad oe TPU is there go to rutime ow you have a chage rutime type ad there is a GPU is there ad TPU is there so the GPU is there ad TPU is there so if it is a big data you ca use that if it is ot big data do't use that that is ot a issue ad your file is there ad code optio is there text optio is there the beauty of Google collab otebook is it is ca work as a text Word documet you ca write some mathematics you ca write some images ad you ca do the code also that is the beauty of this okay so GPU ad TPU actually wheever you wat to use that right wheever the big data is at to speed up the process to speed up the process we have GPU ad we have TPU is there okay GPU ad TPU like suppose you have a big data is there you have a big data is there wheever you have a big data you eed to process very fast right wheever you wat to very fast you wat to process that we have local we have what CPU will be available locally we have CPU will be available well like four CPUs or three CPC level but GPU is a graphical Processig Uit geerally will speed up your process speed of your process to load suppose thik like that your data set your data set has oe 10 lakh observatio or 1 millio observatios 1 millio observatios to load 1 millio observatios how much time it will take i local how much time it will take local how much time will take i Google collab otebook that is the thig i collab otebook we have a GPU access ad we have a TPU access so that it we ca read very fast it ca read very fast it will be very slow so I ca say CPU is the lowest table GPU is highest level ad TPU is the very fast TPU is a very fast okay so if you wat the CPU this is the key iside GPU I ca use our ame TP is othig but tesor tesor processig uit GP is othig but graphical graphical processig uit ad uiverse if you write what is CPU cetral processig uit Cetral processig uit okay ow we are goig to here agai ow I wat to do my ml Ops here I just wat right here ml offs okay so my my I just write the otes also that is a beauty I like this Jupiter otebooks because you ca write the uh story also ot oly story like I ca do the image also okay I'm goig to here suppose MLS so I'm just takig oe image okay I just wat to show you this image which image I wat to take okay this image I will take ow go to the ispect ad there's a image okay the image is there right you are seeig that image go to the edit as HTML just copy this ad come to here go to the text ad Page this see image is comig ow that's the beauty you ca do the mathematics also like this you ca create the mathematics also okay ow step oe step oe step oe is ay ay ay pack ay code if you wat right you eed to istall a required packages istall required packages istall a required packages ow what is the packages we will use is we will use we wat to istall some packages so I will just display the packages ames here so here we will use a umpy package ad padas package ad sql package ad ml flow package okay umpy package used for what is a umerical pytho umerical pytho it is used for mathematics used for mathematics ad padas package user for data frame ad data aalysis sql package is used for machie learig algorithms machie learig algorithms ow ml flow is the ml flow is our ml operatios platform mlos platform MLS platform ow we'll see what is ml flow ow we'll just write here ml flow so ml flow is a platform for machie learig life cycle ow it is a ml Price look like this i the slow lae ow i the few miutes you will get to kow about what is this the latest versio is 2.2.2 it is a cloud package it is a cloud package we eed to istall this so this is default it will be there default default pytho it will be there o eed to istall ad here also this is padas also o eed to istall o eed to istall ad SQL ad also o eed to istall ml flow is the cloud package we eed to istall this okay ml flow is we eed to istall that first ml flow is there or ot there you just apply like this exclamatory Mark ml flow exclamatory Mark ml flow if you ru this if it is istalled you will get some to see somethig if it is ot istalled you will see commad ot foud okay you will see commad ot foud so that meas it is ot istalled so we will istall ow that is PIP istall ml flow simple if istall ml flow ow just istall this pip istall ml flow ow very good it is istalled so what it is istalled mac o databricks docker git database git pytho ad where is our ml flow here is ml flow you see right versus 2.2.2 ow the same thig we will ru here ml flow it is istalled ow so you will see somethig like this before what happeed if it is ot istalled you'll see commad ot foud after istallatio you ca see the some iformatio right this is good ow ext if you wat to see the versio also ow if you wat to see the versio ml flow versio so the latest versio is what 2.2.2 ow the same thig we have see here 2.2 it is released i 14th March oly so MLS is doe ow ext thig is import required packages I hope you clear the first poit right everyoe we istall a package i the step oe we istall a package i the step oe ow step two foreig what is that import required packages import required packages first package is import umpy as NP import ERS SP ow ow sql model ow I wat to give the iformatio here ow here I wat to use I wat to use a regressio model okay I wat to use a regressio model ame called elasticet the model ame is what elastic et model this is a model ame guys it is a regressio model you already kow what is the regressio model right regressio model is a supervised algorithm algorithm supervisor algorithm that meas we have iput will be there ad output will be there but output is output is i umerical data output is umerical data for this we ca use regressio algorithms that you already kow that is so what model I wat to use I wat to use a regressio model what is the ame of the model elasticet so ame of the model is elastic et data set I am takig is called wie quality data wie quality data what the data set ame is called wie quality data that meas I will tell you I will show the data set ad I will tell you what is your wie quality data ad platform we are usig Google collab otebook Google collab otebook ad the objective is here is objective what is your mai target is we eed to predict predict the quality of the quality of the wie so that is the data set ame is called wie quality data ad the model ame is called elastic et this is clear so ow from skl dot liear model dot liear model import elastic et will come automatically yeah elastic et that is doe ext from skl dot model selectio dot model selectio import trai test split I will tell you what is the tred test split I will tell you ext I wat to evaluate my model also right for that from skl dot matrix import these are some metrics these are some metrics mea absolute error mea squared error ad some R to score Do't Paic ow okay these are the some metrics those already kow about regressio aalysis they kow very well those who do't kow also do't eed to paic oce you lear you will easily uderstad oly thig is this will give your model performace okay if this will give your moral performace that's why we are sayig what metrics ad this is a skeleto is a package iside we have a liear model iside we have a elastic et agai sql is the package iside we have a model selectio ad we are importig trai test split I will tell you what is the strai test split ext oe is import ml flow ad we ca say import ml flow dot SK learig so these are my packages it is istalled ow step two is istall the packages is doe we are good at step two also right we are good at step two also yeah ow step three step three read the data read the data step three is read the data ow to read the data if you see here the file locatio is their files just click o this files ow you will see some Arrow will be there wheever you click o the files you will see some Arrow ow if you click o the Arrow I have some data sets will be there here I have wie quality red is there I am importig the data so ow the data is there why i quality red agai I'm repeatig guys we have some files locatio is there click o the files locatio click o the up Arrow it will redirect to your locatios okay ow iside we have oe data set will be there I uploaded that data ow I will read my data I will read my data ow data equal to PD dot read CSV PD dot read CSV I eed to provide the path iside I eed to provide the path there the three dots will be there here there are three dots will be there go to here there's a copy path will be available copy path ow copy that ad come to here ad ow apply data dot head it will give top five rows ow see this is my data it is my data fixed acidity volatile acidity citric acid these all are some chemical ames ow we have a Target is what called quality is our Target quality is our Target variable quality so these all are iput data sets ad this is our output colum it is a supervised learig ad it is a regressio problem it is a supervised supervised learig ad it is a regressio problem as simple as that ow just uderstad the data what are the colums are there o see first we'll uderstad how may rows ad how may colums are there that is give data dot shape so there are 149 ad rows are there ad 12 colums are there what it will give the iformatio this data set ad 12 colums are there 12 colums are there so i that 12 colums 11 colums are iput colums iput colum that is X ad oe colum that is what is the colum ame quality what is the colum ame quality ow quality is output colum output you ca say Target colum we geerally deoted by small y okay so we have 1 5 9 ad of course ad 12 colums i the 12 11 colums are iput colums ad oe colum is called is very good it is a regressio problem because we have quality is umerical data okay why it is a regressio problem quality is a target output colum output colum has umerical data umerical data so that's why it is called regressio yes very good umerical colum ow you got the poits very good that is excellet ow data dot shape ow that is completed ow you ca see data dot colums also i the quick way so our iterest is we are ot doig ay EDI here our iterest is to deploy model o the mloffs what is our iterest is our iterest is model developmet model developmet ad deploymet to develop a model to develop a model make sure we have all the colums all the colums have umerical data why umerical data mathematics math works oly o umbers oly o umbers so if ay categorical data is there we eed to covert ito umerical so first we will check where the umerical data is there or ot for that data.ifo will apply data.ifo ow it will see all our types of float float float o umerical ode categorical data all our umerical data we are put ad there's o ull values also see all our ormal it is a colum umber called fixed acidity umber is 159 error rows ad it is a o ull values ad data type is float 64. we are good you ca check this also data dot is ull dot sum if ay ull values is there for the correspodig colum wise it will give the sytax so we do't have ay ull values so we are good we do't have ull values ad we have the data is umerical way so we ca create our model developmet that is a step four ow step four step four just write like this model developmet usig ml flow ow here I wat to show you how the model developmet Geeral will happe okay so step oe is this is a very very importat step guys we eed to uderstad this is okay what I am tellig you is ow importat everyoe should uderstad first we divide we divide data ito two parts two parts oe is traied oe is traied data ad aother oe is test data okay we divide i two parts oe is traied data ad aother is test data ad secod is trai data as iput ad output tested data also as iput ad output agai we divide we divide traied data trai data ito iput data ad okay iput data ad output that meas iput colum separately output colums operatig so that we ca say exit trai ad wide trai simple we divided iput colum separately ad output colums separately ad the the same way we divide test data ito X test data ad Y test data first of all trai data data device data ad test data both havig iput colums ad output colums so we are separatig ito Excel trai y trai XO test ad Y test ad the model developmet model developmet happes o trai data o traied data model developmet will happe o trai data so ext step is model developmet will happe traied data the oce your model is created you eed to test right so I wat to model test so I wat to model predictios model predictios happes o X test data accept test data so this will give this will give y predictios very simple guys I have created my model the I wat to check my model is performed well or ot so I will pass X test ad model it will give some values that is we are callig y predictios fially fially I will compare I will compare my y predictios with Y test why predictios why predictios with Y test so this is the etire flow ow I just wat to show you maybe for write up you will cofuse but I will show you ow here how it will happe just see origial data iput colums are X1 X2 XP output colum is y we divide ito four parts trai data test data agai trai data is extra trai while trai X test y test what does that mea thik like that you have a data is like this you have a data is like this X is oe two three four Y is oe four ie sixtee twety five First Step Oe is divide ito two parts trai data test data the exitrai y trai X test y test ow come here this is the tred at first three observatios is the trai data last two observatios are the test data so it is a trai data extra trai white trai test data is a last observatio XO test y test ow my model is applied o which data trai data so I created a model called Y is equal to x square ow I will pass 4 to the Y is equal to x square I will get a predictio called 16. I will pass Y is equal to Phi to the x square I will got the prestified so my predictios are what 16 ad 25 ow I will compare the 1625 already existed 16 ad 25 so this is the compariso so this is geerally ml developmet flow will happe I hope this is clear right uderstadig this is very very importat guys so you geerally divide the data that's it you geerally divide the data ito two parts that's the trai data ad test data ad agai EXO trai ad Y trai so to do to do all these thigs to do all these thigs we have trai test split Eglish ame Commo Sese Eglish commo Eglish ame trai test split it is a SK L package what is this sql package so what I will do is I will divide I will divide my data ito 70 30 ratio 70 30 ratio that meas out of 5159 observatios of 70 percet of 70 percet is my trai data okay out of 1599 observatios 30 percet is my test data ow ad also I will divide trai ad test data radomly I will divide radomly that meas the idea how will be like oe two three four five like this oe ad so oe five ie  will be there so I will divide the trai data I will pick first fifth observatio I will pick 10th observatio I'll pick 500 observatio radomly I will pick okay y will pick radomly to avoid the bias to avoid the bias what is mea by bias suppose u r a you are a fa of Virat Kohli okay you are a fa of Virat Kohli I will call you I will ask you who is your favorite cricketer what you will say you'll say Virat Kohli oly suppose Sharma ad I will ask you who who is your fa Roy Sharma you will say so if I pick you the bias this is the bias if I pick the radomly this output might be differet this output might be differet this output might be differet so Cosolidated my model will give that good output so that's why Always divide the data radomly do't go with order okay oe oe two thousad is a traied data trai data ad oe zero zero oe two sixtee hudred is a test data this will give the bias do't go like this first thousad observatio pick radomly secod 1600 observatio agai pick radomly so this we will do what we will do divide data ito 70 30 ratio ad pick the observatios i the radomly ow we will do that okay how we'll do that here so trai is oe test is aother oe so I will apply trai test split trai test split iside I eed to pass my data ad I eed to pass my test size is equal to 0.3 what is this mea we are dividig data ito sevety thirty percet ow I will apply radom state radom State equal to you ca give ay umber oe two three four you ca give oe two you ca give aythig you ca give radomly it will pick okay ow trai dot shape ad test dot shape okay ow see out of 159 observatios oe oe ie observatio is your trai data 480 observatios are your test data ow if I go for trai dot head trai.head I will see radomly it is speakig first of the reaso is what 642 secod observatio 678 third four oe two fourth oe sevety three good right these are great actually we are dividig ito 70 30 ad we are applyig radom so if we got divided traied data ad test data ow we eed to divide X to trai ad ow ow divide data ito EXO trai trai X ad trai y iput colum output colum separately we already kow ow trai X equal to out of this all the colums if I remove this quality if I remove this quality remaiig colums are what trai data remaiig colums are traied data so trai dot drop I am droppig a colum quality quality I'm droppig so it is a colum so we eed to give X is equal to 1. so that's the trai data i the same way test data Test X so test data dot drop agai same quality comma X is equal to 1. so we divided iput data i the trai data we divide we got the iput data ad test also we got the iput data ow we get the output oe trai why so out of this strai data if I select oly quality colum if I select oly quality colum that is my output data that is my output data so trai dot ow you ca select oly the quality that's it ow test Y is equal to test quality ow that's it we're doe ow you ca check your trai x dot shape dot shape ad trai y dot shape out of 12 colums 11 colums are iput colum ad oe colum is what output colum right see total trade observatios are triple oe ie i that 11 colums are your trai X ad oly oe colum is what trai y i the same way we have Test X ad test y dot shape four AIT is eleve that the test data ad oe colum is output data so we divided Tred test split is that clear rate till ow if radom state is 0 istead of pickig 642 it will pick aother value okay if you give aother radom state it will give you so how ca you pass suppose I am givig oe dot here if oe dot okay how may lies how may lies ca pass through oe dot tell me what is your aswer how may lies you ca pass through oe dot Ifiity yes like that radom State you ca give ay value it ca pick ifiite times maybe after 642 it will come after four oe two will come after 73 will come 678 will come last so wheever you chage this value the goal is fixed it will pick the radomly but the umbers will be differet that's all ow we'll go to the our mai step ow step fifth ow start ml flow step fifth start ml flow start ml flow yeah ext ml flow is a cloud algorithm ml flow is what ml flow is a cloud platform is a cloud platform ow what I my what is my task I wat to develop a model I wat to develop a model ad I wat to deploy I wat to deploy o ML flow oe he eed to deploy a ml flow ext suppose Abhishek Abhishek is created aother model oe agai you eed to create a you eed to deploy ml flow okay ow this yeah radom state that is a radom state is othig but agai I told you right it is a radomly it will pick that well radomly it will pick that that is a radom state okay I hope I give your aswer already yeah oe two three four that oly if I give radom State equal to oe two three four ow tell me like this oe comma 2 comma three comma four comma five six seve eight ie te ow radomly it will stop with oe after that how may combiatios will come secod letter how may combiatios secod letter will come how may combiatios third letter will come how may combiatio fourth letter will come radomly may right so that may we will provide by usig called radom state radom state if you give radom State equal to oe it will give oe order two three four like oe oe oe oe oe oe oe oe oe oe like this so wheever you chage your radom State the umbers will be chaged here that's why I am explaiig okay yeah so ext so uderstad this is guys this start ml flow is very very importat ow omkar creates oe model you wat to deploy a ml flow object created oe model he wats to display a ml flow that meas what ml flow will do ml flow will create some workspace some workspace for you some workspace i the ame of i the ame of experimet what is the ame here ame of experimet remember this ml flow will create some workspace i the ame of experimet so first we eed to create our experimet what we'll do first to create our experimet so that is ml flow dot set experimet set experimet I'm givig some path my path is ml flow ml flow ad you are givig mL of ml Ops workspace MLS workspace so this is my ame this is my workspace ame you ca create your ow workspace okay you ca give ay ame also you ca give arratio M also here okay you ca give your ame also that meas you are settig a experimet why you are settig your experimet there are thousads of people who ca create their model ad they wat to deploy a ml flow ml flow should uderstad what is your experimet ame what is your workspace ame that ml flow should uderstad that that's why we are creatig a experimet ame ow this experimet is ot there so you see here experimet with ame ml flow mL of workspace does ot exist so we are creatig ad this is your experimet ID ad this is the life stages active ad artifact locatio I will tell you what is artifact locatio it will go to this locatio this is the locatio path okay we'll just prit some values we'll just prit some values so prit I'll just copy this dot experimet ID I'm just givig experimet ID ad agai I am prit this because I wat to use that ID I wat to use that ID so life cycle stage is active agai prit ad you ca give ame also so if I prit all these three ow first oe is my experimet ID ame this is my experimet ID so ow this is your ID ow your workspace is active what is your workspace ame ml flow mL of workspace I hope this you clear ow right ca I get aswer i the chat box this is uderstadig is importat ml flow set experimet yeah code ow experimet is ready ow we'll go to the code ow we'll go to the code ow so I will create some fuctio call because I wat to write multiple times so what I will do is I will create some fuctio call So Def trai model deftrai model is my fuctio called ame so first step is what developed develop trai test split I wat to divide my data that I already show you how to divide the data so we'll just copy from there because we already did that so what I will do is I will take this I'm takig this this is I have doe separated to make you uderstad guys okay this add-o separated to make you uderstad because uderstadig that is very very importat ow this is we have take so this is importat so I just remove this I do't wat this okay ow your trai model is doe ow ow secod is iitiate the ml flow ow iitiate iitiate ml flow ow so we are iitiatig ow with ml flow dot start ru let us start ru is there ml flow dot start ru iside it is askig some experimet ID you eed to provide your experimet ID what is your ru ame okay you ca give your ame also ad you ca give a descriptio also so I am providig my experimet ID experimet ID what is my experimet ID so this is my experimet ID right this is my experimet ID comma my ru ame I wat to provide ru ame also that is it is a regressio it is a regressio ad I will provide the descriptio also it is a descriptio also I wat to provide what is the descriptio here aythig aythig you ca write performig a regressio aalysis so this all we ca see UI ow ml flow UI we ca see this all so this is the fuctio call so we are puttig colos here ad we are ruig this okay experimet ID a ru ame ad descriptio ow Now call ml model ow call ml model what is your ml model ame ml model ame is called elasticet so I ca give LR equal to I am takig a variable ame called LR because liear regressio so elastic et elastic et so iside what are the parameters are comig Alpha is the oe parameter ad L1 ratio is aother parameter there are two parameters oe is Alpha ad aother is L1 ratio so I am givig Alpha Alpha is equal to some Alpha I am providig ad L1 ratio L1 ratio equal to L1 ratio I'm providig because these are my parameters I wat to chage these parameters every time I created a ew model okay mid it that I wat to chage these parameters I am creatig a ew model so L1 ratio why this is error is comig because these are the parameters we eed to give you the fuctio also Alpha comma L1 ratio ow this will goe ow elastic et is there ow fit ow develop your model model developmet o which data trai data so trai X comma trai y this is your model is developed so model creatio is happeed ow what we'll do model predictio ow model predictio model predictio will happe o which data X test data X test data model predictio will be happe so that is predicted data predicted data equal to LR dot predict because your model is which ame is there LR so LR dot predict which data you eed to pass Test X so this is model predictio ow be careful guys just uderstad this three steps first trai test plate ext call the model ext fit the model ext model predictio so ext what we will do model evaluatio model evaluatio ow model evaluatio what are your evaluatio techiques you have take rmse this three mea absolute error mai square error R2 Square so model evaluatio will compare o which data which data model evaluatio predictios versus test data predictio forces test data so that we will do evaluatio ow that we will do evaluatio so here rmsc equal to NP dot square root NP dot square root mea squared error mea squared error bracket you eed to compare with your test y with the predicted data simple ow RMS RMS root mea square error guys RMS is othig but what root mea square error I will tell you what is the root mea square error so first error equal to your actual value y actual value mius y predicted value okay suppose actual value is equals 16 is there your model is predicted as 17. how much your error is gettig mius 1 like that so this is error ow we eed to mea square error so first we eed to square this ad the we eed to apply mea is othig but summatio of may observatios first observatio first error error oe secod observatio error 2. third observatio error 3. so you eed to combie all the errors Error 1 Plus error 2 Place error 3 error 3 ad this we are squarig Square 1 square 2 square 3 we are applyig a mea so this is called mai square error the ame itself what mea square error if you apply the root that is called rmse so this is a metric okay I'm ot goig to about much deal much deeper i that because that is ot our iterest right I just wat to give you a quick glace what is rmse it is a root mai square error that is a rmsc ext mea e m a is othig but mea absolute error these are the metrics these are the Matrix mai absolute error so agai same y test sorry test y comma predicted data agai R2 Square R2 is equal to R2 score of test y comma predicted data so this is the full plasma so we are callig model modal predictio modal evaluatio till ow is that clear everyoe foreig we will do that I am ot comig to that way okay we'll do that model register we will do okay we are goig step by step good ow you eed to log these parameters what is the ext step is importat is I wat to track my I wat to track my modal parameters ad model metrics ad model ame so this is called we are registerig we wat to register our models we wat to register our metrics we wat to register our parameters so for that what we will do is we eed to go for here we eed to log that parameters you ca prit also while doig you ca prit also I'll just prit this okay prit prit Mia sorry comma Mae ad prit that R2 score comma R2 score so we are pritig ow ext importat is what log The Matrix log this Matrix parameters parameters ad model o ML flow o ML flow okay so ow ml flow DOT log uder the log we have artifacts is there Matrix is there param scissor okay so we are goig for log param so log param o which ame I wat to log this my ame is Alpha Alpha is my ame I wat to log Alpha agai same ml flow DOT log param what is I what is the param ow L1 ratio L1 ratio is my param that is called L1 ratio so parameters are completed ow ml flow ow Matrix ow there are three metrics are there ml flow ml flow DOT log metric DOT log metric okay what is the metric first oe RMS is my metric ame whatever you give here ame that will be visible guys if you give your your ame that will be visible okay so rmsc ad same thig I wat to just copy here two times but here is Mia [Music] ad here Mae ad the here R2 square that is equal to R2 ow this is doe ow I wat to log what I wat to log my model also ml for ML flow Dot skl so we have already sql is there right skl DOT log model what is that DOT log model what is your model ame your model ame is what LR what your model ame LR so my model ame is called LR comma the ame is called modal ow what is your register model I wat to register my model I wat to register my model so registered model ame is equal to elastic et my model ame is called elasticet oce you created your LR model that will be uder the model it will register we will see that ow how it will happe ow I'm just ruig this okay ow what are the two parameters takig Alpha ad L1 ratio we are callig this trai model okay ow we are callig this so I am givig here suppose 0.3 ad I'm givig here 0.2 ow I'm ruig this ow see rmsc is this Mei is this ow you see successfully model is registered with ame what elastic et ad what is the versio versio is oe these are importat to otice what your model ame is called elastic et what is the versio versio is oe ow wheever you ru i the left side there is a ml rus folder will be created okay i the left side ml rus folder will be created if you click o the ml rus if you click o the ml rus there is a your experimet ID will be there if you otice this is your experimet ID guys okay go to here check your experimet ID where is the experimet IDC so this experimetary five six five three two five six five three to your experimet ID ow here your models is there i the model there is a model m is what elastic et that you give right elastic et that model you give here elastic et what is the versio here oly oe versio oly oe versio is there ow if you click o the versio if you click o this method.aml you will see what is the timestamp what is updated what is the ame what is the Ru ID this is importat what is the Ru ID with this ru ID if you go to your experimets the same ru IDs will be there here see same ru ID ow if you go to the iside ru ID we have five thigs oe is artifacts Matrix params ad tags Matrix meas what you log rmse Mia R2 that Matrix will come to here what is the value 0.51 see 0.51 is your value what is R2 0.23 is your value what is rmse 0.66 your value this is a matrix ad what parets you give Alpha ad L1 ratio 0.3 ad 0.2 so this is the artifacts artifacts is othig but your model that pickle will be available so your model ow you ca had over to cliet bios called Model dot pickle ad to ru this etire setup what is your requiremet.txt I eed ml flow This Cloud pickle pathlib sql typig extesio so everythig will be available here guys okay everythig will be available here so agai I am repeatig so just see here just otice this so this is ot the fial thig we eed to show this i the ml flow UI that is our ultimate goal okay ow see here wheever you created your ml flow workspace they clearly say artifact locatio is cotet ml rus three two five three two so wheever you ru your code it will create a ml rus iside it will create a experimet ID ow iside you are you have ru oly oe time right that's why oe ruide is created suppose I have ru two secod time ow see see the beauty here suppose I give a value is called four argumet value is called five ow same ame that meas I am ruig secod time uderstood the same ame I am ruig secod time that mea ow versio 2 should create right ow I ru this ow euro ew ru ID Now ew versio is created versio two ow you go here you go here just refresh this go to your models elastic et is your ame oly oly oe ame uder oe ame how may versios is created ow two versios versio oe versio two what is your versio ID what is your versio ID is your versio ID ow go iside the experimet ow you ca see seve to be user oe more IDE ad all your metrics will be ow here params everythig will be here so this is how it will works ml flow ow our mai goal is we eed to show we eed to show this o ML flow UI first of all are you uderstad till ow this yeah yes correct exactly two metrics we ca use may metrics Nai okay why we are drop quality we are ot droppig we are droppig ad we are processig here you see here okay that is the overall story right I'm sayig while you are passig you are creatig your model we are ot droppig you are passig your trai X ad trai y why is your quality oly okay ml models packages pytho packages will create such that you eed to pass your iput ad output separately that's why we are droppig okay ow everythig we are loggig ot oly rmsc meae there are so may metrics will be available oce you lear about data sciece course you will get to kow that okay ext ow you uderstad ow what is our goal is ml flow UI ow thik like this ow I wat to go to the ml flow UI so this is your Google collab otebook okay this is your Google colum book this is your ml flow platform this is your ml flow UI whatever you doe ow you eed to trasfer here right to do this to do this we eed to create some tuel what you eed to create a tuel tuel you eed to create ormal Eglish ame create so to coect Google collab to ml flow UI we eed to create a tuel what we eed to create tuel so I will tell you what is the tuel ow so ow I will give all aswers ow at the ed ow okay because it should ot miss the flow ml flow UI to ru to create to create ml flow UI from Google collab otebook Google collab otebook we eed to create a tuel we eed to create a tuel ad that tuel ame is called the tuel ame is grok what is the ame is called grok Remember the Name  grok what is the ame  Grog what is grok grok is your tuel who is created this way the road okay the compay ame the compay ame is grok what the compay will do it will create a tuel from your local collab otebook to your UI that is called tuel ormal Eglish ame it is a road the road compay ame is called grok compay ame is what  grok ow we will pip istall pip istall ad grog first okay I eed to istall that grok ow  grok is istallig ad grock is istallig ow  gruck is istalled ow what we will do is we'll try to create a tuel create a tuel ow create a tuel we will create a tuel so pip istall from pi ad grok import grok okay pi ad grok I thik we eed to istall pi ad grock I thik ot oly utritioal Pie Grove because grok is ot workig owadays will work okay ad grog they are removig egrock actually they are callig that the pi ad Croc so pi ad grok ad grog so ext we eed to create a tuel tuel ad grow I will give a ame called grok tuel I will give you ad grog tuel equal to  grok dot coect it is a UI right wheever you wat to coect a UI we eed to give some address also that address geerally people will give 5000 report okay ad prototype also we eed to give that is http so this is I do't eed to explai because there is a UI UI should be i our server so that's why we are givig 5000 port i the http ow what we will do will prit will prit a trackig URI a trackig URI with the ame of trackig URI I wat to track my  Grog uderscore tuel Dot Public URI ayoe ca access public URL I'm just clickig this okay very simple guys we are tuel this is a compay compay ame is called grok we are coectig with address 5000. I'm just clickig this whe I clickig this what they are sayig traffic was successfully tuel to the grok aget but aget failed to establish ow we created a tuel successfully but this aget is ot givig permissio to create a UI why this is Aget is ot give permissio because you should ot provide a autheticated ID the aget does't kow the aget aget does't kow does't kow your ID your ID so that's why he is ot givig permissio he is ot givig permissio simple guys first what we are goig we are goig to a compay called grok to make a tuel from which place to which place Google collab Notebook 2 Google collab Notebook 2 your ml flow UI ml flow UI so we created a tuel but the tuel is ot givig permissio because we does't provide our ID ow what we will do we will provide our ID ow so get help with this error ow it will reach to here you just click o the logi just click o the logi ow whe you log i it will ask your email ID ad it will create with homecare.alagoi real gmail.com okay it wheever you log i it will ask your Gmail ID we already have Gmail ID is ope that's why it is goig directly ow go ito the your Autheticatio go to the or autheticatio ow this is your autheticatio ID okay I just pass ito the uh Google collab otebook okay like this I'm goig to edit as HTML I just copy this I'm just pastig i the Google collab otebook ad just paste here so that I ca access from here oly so this is my ID this is my ID so this is my auth ID so autheticatio ID autheticatio toke equal to this is my authority so my give my autheticatio ID ow same thig I will take okay same thig I am takig if you have autheticatio ID you do't eed to go to here guys okay o eed to go to here if you do't have autheticatio ID first ru this the it will redirect to oe place it will redirect to oe place ad the if you go to help it will redirect to aother place the logi it will redirect to your Gmail gmail.com from there you will get autheticatio toke directly copy for every email ID oe autheticatio toke will be available oe autheticatio toke will be available the postma we ca't use Abhishek here that's a differet case i the API testig so this is a creatig a tuels okay ow udershow right if you have autheticatio toke is there do't go directly here directly you ca write like this so I am creatig this here if already a tuel is established I wat to kill the tuel so I wat to do  grog.kill already a tuel is already existed I am killig the tuel okay so this is I ca say if ay tuels are there if ay ope tuels are there close that so for that  grok dot kill ow autheticatio toke ow ad ow said that  grok dot set Auto toke author toke your auth toke what is your author toke authorizatio uderscore to agai I have set my toke my set so I give my ID whe I give my ID I ca create the tuel ow simple step by step uderstad the steps if ay tuels are there kill the tuels cue your autheticatio toke set your toke ad create the tuel ow tuel is created okay ow we'll click o this whe I click o this ow see there is o error it is askig visit site whe it is askig visit site this is we are we are success we're good so for that we eed to ru ml flow UI we eed to ru what ml flow UI we eed to ru so ml flow UI wheever you ru ad the you go to here withi the site whe you visit the site it will create a UI see how beautifully the UI is ow agai I'm repeatig guys oe we provided autheticatio toke we ru this it will cost the visit site oce it is doe you eed to ru your ml flow UI util you work o this this code is still ru oly ow we'll just familiar with ML flow UI what is your experimet ID tell me what is your experimet ID ame what is your workspace ame what your workspace ame guys ml offs uderscore somethig oe right see this is your workspace ml flow ml Ops workspace how may times you model do you ru two times you have ru oe is 16 miutes ago aother is 12 miutes ago what is your model ame oe is first oe versio 16 miutes ago you have ru that is the oe versio oe 12 miutes ago you have ru that is versio two ow if you click o place you have Matrix is there your parameters is there you ca compare those also ow first time whe I ru that is 0.511 ad secod time 0.547 first time whe I ru 0.662 secod time 0.694 this way is othig but model trackig modal performace model moitor okay we'll go step by step agai this is ml flow workspace iside how may times you create a ru your model two times what is your ru ame regressio is your our ru ame what is your Matrix we already logged all these metrics ow I'm just clickig o regressio ow this is your ru ID this is your ru ID ad model is registered here model is registered o 2023 0 4 16. what is the ame of the model elastic et what is the versio is a V1 ow your model is registered this is your model.pickle file this is your amml file ml file will give you what what is the depedecies what is the PIP fuctios ad everythig this is your ml model everythig so if you dowload this if you dowload this you ca had out to your cliet he ca ru ad he ca get the output that's be some simple that is okay ow parameters uder this ru ID what are the values uder this ru ID what are the metrics ad what are the work model everythig that is your models artifacts ad everythig ad they also give your predictio code also you ca directly call this oe ad you ca do this so we'll go step by step agai okay first step go to your workspace uderstad this UI how may times you have ru two times what is your ru ame regressio what is your model ame elastic et go to your models how may what is your model ame elasticet what is your latest versio versio 2 click o this how may times you have ru two times oe is versio oe aother is versio two so it is trackig versio also if you ru oe more thig it is versio three it is versio 3. ow do you feel which versio of model is good do you feel do you feel which versio of model is good support is sayig sir my versio oe model is good versio oe model is good suppose Abhishek is sayig my versio model is good my versio is model is good ow there's a two steps will be there guys oe is stagig ad aother oe is productio okay stagig is othig but what stagig is othig but it is a Alpha versio Alpha versio productio is othig but beta versio that meas stagig is othig but it is o our local systems it is iteral use iteral use that meas we are ot give to the cliet to that those models are i the productio level that cliet ca use okay i outside idustry we have two thigs are there oe stagig will be there aother oe is productio is there I am thikig I am thikig versio oe versio oe is a good model is a good model that ca go ito the productio level is sayig that sir my versio oe model is good I wat to set up ito the productio level so for that what we will use we will go to the versio oe the the stage will be there trasitio to stagig trasitio to productio or you do't wat to use this model go to Archive so versio oe is model is good I wat to use i the productio the I am puttig the productio level ow I'll go to my elastic et I am goig to my models ow my elastic et is my model ame what is my latest versio versio 2 is my latest versio but what is i the productio productio is the versio oe is there i the productio ow you thik versio 2 is i the stagig ow go to i the versio 2 put i the stagig eviromet ow people will thik like that this versio 2 is ow i the stagig level already versio 1 is sedig ito the productio level so cliet ca use the versio oe model but versio 2 is i the iteral use oly still developmet is goig o that is the meaig of stagig level this is a meaig of productio level ad you ca go to the experimets ad you ca get the versio to model also from your workspace this is a versio 2 model this is a ru ID this is a metrics everythig will be there so this is we are loggig we are register the model we are deploy the model we are trackig the model we are model versioig is happeig ad fially i ext few miutes we will iferece the model also we will see so this is the beauty of ml Ops guys s ow I will give pass you ca ask me if ay doubts thak you Abhishek you ca put i the chat because we almost completed this ad oly the iferecig is there I will show the iferece also ow if you wat ppds mL of a third party server provider exactly rajwal mL of you kow the beauty of this oe uh how it is oly three guys are rollig here okay oly three guys i the world oe is gcp oe is AWS oe is azure okay ow what we'll do I am workig with Acceture right so called Acceture or TCS or Ifosys we do't have ay Cloud setup right we do't have ay Cloud setup what we will do we will pay the moey to will pay the moey to either gcp Service as a AWS service or Azure service so they will offer this mlos platform or automl so called like this they will perform like this so ml Ops ow databricks is there that is also you ca use ml office tie up with so may compaies ml flow like that so every ew data we eed to work o the lower eviromet oce we test i the stage exactly exactly that is the correct but we eed to create some Pipelies okay you will ot create automatically you every time you should ot go you should ot create you will create some Pipelies how the pipelies will be there data igestio ad the data pre-processig pre-processig ad data Eda ow Eda is the very biggest star spread i the ideas there are so may drop tasks will be there feature selectio will be there feature egieerig will be there so may thigs will be there ad the we'll deploy a models ad the you log eter everythig yeah yeah that is the GitHub actios is importat ow you you I developed a suppose i my team ivitig five members are there okay five members are there I have worked I have worked o model developmet okay you are workig you are workig o Eda okay some other perso is workig o data igestio we all created dot py files oly dot py it's also dot py file oly this is also dot P Wi-Fi oly ow this all dot pofi ow I there's a GitHub is there ow you will push your code i the GitHub or GitHub or devops whatever it is you will push your record i the GitHub GitHub ad this guy also put your code i the GitHub there's a oe guy is there devops guy there's a oe guy is the devops guy what he will do he will Cosolidated our course Cosolidated our codes ad he will trigger the pipelie so that course ca be updated course ca be updated oce course ca be updated with ew code with a ew code your pipelie tree will trigger your ml flow will be triggered so that is called git actios that is also we will ed i our arratio so ew data ever go directly to the plot o ever produce productio level cliet should use cliet will ask may questios you kow you kow right how may cliet will ask the questios they ever uderstad aythig but we eed to explai to them everythig so ever go directly actual Adroid is what is happeig right so I am workig a compay called make SM okay ow make a si so we are developig some ml models to the vacatio we are developig some ml models ow the makers ad the data from the data they are gettig from PWC PWC that meas PWC is respodig for data they will give the medicie ow make a set equal to the Acceture ow data egieerig guys will do the data igestio ow data sciece will guide to the model developmet ow ml egieerig I will do the mL of both are same you are doig the same task owadays ow these guys always talk with PWC data ow this guy will say exted to the makasa how it is happeig ad everythig like that yeah yeah Rosha you ca cotact with admi we are we are startig that MLS batch so oce cliet everyoe certified share will push the product correct vekat you're absolutely correct our model do Ed automatically yeah we eed to create some Pipelies okay but this you eed to cotact with uh admi okay yeah we'll create a Pipelies so it is ot over those completed data sciece so we ca uh data sese it is good for two data sciece also if you kow the good go to data sese the you ca do that or you ca call to uht we will give a clear guidace o this actually we have oe more step is there guys okay wait for last miute okay we have oe more step is there what is our oe more step we reduce the predictios just copy this okay I'm just stoppig this ow okay ow this is my model this is my model which model versio 2 model I am loadig my model I wat to pass my test text the I will get my outputs these are my outputs if ay ew data will come they'll directly pass here ad they will get the output as simple as that because this is a free versio that's why we are stoppig ad we are ruig ad we are goig ad checkig there's a paid versios will be there actually if you pay that the you ca do automatically this that thig if this is a prepared versio is ot a paid versio that's why we are stoppig here whe you stop your ml flow will goe does UI will goe so that is a simple drawback here because we are usig a free versio right that's why so ow this is a ed to ed ml flow guys I hope you uderstood the everythig flow okay I hope that we have a very good sessio we have very good sessio you uderstad some extet some extet you uderstood how the life cycle how the data sciece life cycle will happe life cycle will happe so I'm expectig that you ca you ca say that i the chat also eed to Deep dive more yeah this is a simple task Workshop is ot like that Workshop is ot like that it is a simple like it is a first task so that i the goig o we ca do more tasks also that is but what we lear what is ml villai ad ext types of ml villai ad we lear data sciece lifecycle we lear ad we have see some good examples also why we eed ml Ops N2 ad ed to ed flow of mL of ad we lear about practical implemetatio practical implemetatio usig ml flow ml flow so we covered may thigs yeah yeah if ay ay course related because I am a traier right I uh that ay course related ay course related okay erollmets ad everythig the admi guy is there at aresh ID so admi guys are very they are Cooperative they will explai each ad everythig for you you ca cotact to directory we always try to give the best teachig ad best Cocepts to you we always yes defiitely Pawa because data sciece people kow oly what you kow oly to create models right yeah tfx everythig you're correct airflow could be flow everythig will be there you're right yes i the cloud that is specific Cloud we use gcp gcp we ca do that AWS or azure databricks we'll do that say subbu what is happeig right uh I ca say AWS Azure ad everythig is like a mobile phoe okay if you kow oe thig you ca kow other easily if you kow gcp o oe ca teach for Azure also you ca easily kow Azure also oly the thigs like a real me phoe ad iPhoe ad Samsug phoe that's all okay yeah ml apps usig tesorflow that's a t f x t f x ad Kobe flow ad ml flow is all MLS yes Rosha you're right yes all sessios are Hads-O oly mL of meas Hads-O that's it so that you eed to cotact with uh yes we'll cover all these thigs yeah batch ad duratio everythig please cotact to admi I hope you have a good sessio so we always here to provide a best teachig facility to you yeah you ca cotact everythig is admi they will give a best supportive I hope you ejoyed the sessio guys yeah place a yes yeah thak you thak you so much guys bye take care we'll see you\""
